in economics consumer debt is outstanding consumer debt as opposed to that of businesses or governments in macroeconomic terms it is debt which is used to fund consumption rather than investment it includes debts incurred on purchase of goods that are consumable do not appreciate in recent years an alternative analysis might view consumer debt as a way to increase domestic production on the grounds that if credit is easily available the increased demand for consumer goods should cause an increase of overall domestic production the permanent income hypothesis suggests that consumers take debt to smooth consumption throughout their lives borrowing to finance expenditures particularly housing and schooling earlier in their lives and paying down debt during periods both domestic and international economists have supported a recent upsurge in south korean consumer debt which has helped fuel economic expansion on the other hand credit card debt is almost unknown just across the sea in japan and china because of cultural taboos against personal debt theoretical underpinnings aside personal debt is on the rise particularly in the united states and the united kingdom however according to the us federal reserve the us household debt service ratio is at the lowest level since its peak in the fall of the most common forms of consumer debt are credit card debt payday loans and other consumer finance which are often at higher interest rates than secured loans such as mortgages the amount of debt outstanding versus the consumers disposable income is expressed as the consumer leverage ratio on a monthly basis this debt ratio is advised to be no more than percent of an individuals pay the interest rate charged depends on a range of factors including the economic climate perceived ability of the customer to repay competitive pressures from other lenders and the inherent structure and security of the credit product rates generally range from percent above to well into double figures consumer debt is also associated with predatory lending although there is much debate as to what exactly constitutes predatory lending consumer debt is often considered fiscally suboptimal while some consumer items may be useful investments that justify debt such as automobiles which are usually but not always exempted in discussions of consumer debt most consumer goods are not for example incurring consumer debt through buying a television now rather than saving for it can not usually be financially justified by the subjective benefits of having the television early on the other hand personal finance advisers like robert kiyosaki encourage a more liberal attitude towards taking on debt if it can be leveraged into a small business or real estate in many countries the ease with which individuals can accumulate consumer debt beyond their means to repay has precipitated a growth industry in debt consolidation and credit counseling

diluted property rights theory is a macroeconomics theory proposed by founder of holland meissner company amber persons formerly known as monica natasha lester the theory is meant to serve as an extension of property rights theory property rights theory has not received substantial theoretical or empirical attention despite its potential to explain various phenomena dealing with business transactions diluted property rights theory addresses this lack of progression by approaching property rights theory from the position of approximating the conditions that actually exist when rights are negotiated exchanged and handled this is the same approach that nobel prize winner ronald coase took when discovering and clarifying the significance of property rights while property rights theory defines property rights and delineates how the rightful owner of such rights may use enforce transfer and benefit from them diluted property rights theory attempts to define a pervasive violation of a principal of property rights theory writing from a legal perspective coase explains how property rights should be delimited according to coase such rights should go to the party that can create the most public benefit however property rights are often diluted and the party that can create the most public good are not always granted such rights diluted property rights are created when rights are not rights are weakened due to some legal or socially accepted event the diluting event is mediating the diluting event has a significant reprehensive impact the diluting event interferes with the use transfer enforcement or residual claim deriving from ownership of the property right the theory holds that the event need not be reoccurring to make a lasting impression in addition diluted property rights are not extended to incidental violation of the law that reaves a rightful owner of his rights diluted property rights theory is concerned with widespread weakening of rights that are dictated by policy law and norms the concern is that the continued weakening of property rights will have wide spread effects that may be disadvantageous to the world economy this concern is valid in so much as well protected property rights have created benefits to corporations
in new york city a desk appearance ticket dat is an order to appear in the new york city criminal court for an arraignment a person who receives a dat has been arrested the dat is simply one of two alternative means by which a person who is arrested appears for arraignment or first appearance a person who receives a dat is permitted to appear in court on their own on the date indicated on the dat document a person who does not receive a dat is processed through the arrest to arraignment system and is supposed to have their arraignment within hours from the point that the case is arraigned a dat case is like any other criminal case dats are usually only issued for misdemeanors in which there is little chance that the defendant will flee the jurisdiction currently dats may be issued for violation misdemeanors and e felonies if a person fails to return to court on the date indicated on the dat the court will issue an arrest warrant the authority for a dat is found in criminal procedure law which describes a dat as a written notice issued and subscribed by a police officer directing a designated person to appear in a designated local criminal court at a designated future time in connection with his alleged commission of a designated offense a person who is eligible for a dat is not automatically entitled to a dat the decision to proceed by way of dat will always be in the discretion of the police department during the giuliani administration the practice of proceeding by dat was drastically reduced in favor of sending most cases through the traditional arrest to arraignment system this was thought to be a way to ensure that those getting dats did not have outstanding arrest warrants since then the practice of proceeding by way of dat in eligible cases has risen but still is not as common as it once was a universal summons summons ticket is another type of appearance ticket authorized by cpl article that directs a defendant to appear for arraignment at a future date but it also serves as the accusatory instrument unlike a complaint filed by a prosecutor as with a dat and the defendant is not arrested

the police and criminal evidence act pace c is an act of parliament which instituted a legislative framework for the powers of police officers in england and wales to combat crime and provided codes of practice for the exercise of those powers part vi of pace required the home secretary to issue codes of practice governing police powers the aim of pace is to establish a balance between the powers of the police in england and wales and the rights and freedoms of the public equivalent provision is made for northern ireland by the police and criminal evidence northern ireland order si the equivalent in scots law is the criminal procedure scotland act although pace is a fairly wide ranging piece of legislation it mainly deals with police powers to search an individual or premises including their powers to gain entry to those premises the handling of exhibits seized from those searches and the treatment of suspects once they are in custody including being interviewed specific legislation as to more wide ranging conduct of a criminal investigation is contained within the criminal procedures and investigation act criminal liability may arise if the specific terms of the act itself are not conformed to whereas failure to conform to the codes of practice while searching arresting detaining or interviewing a suspect may lead to evidence obtained during the process becoming inadmissible in court pace was significantly modified by the serious organised crime and police act this replaced nearly all existing powers of arrest including the category of arrestable offences with a new general power of arrest for all offences pace is applicable not only to police officers but to anyone with conduct of a criminal investigation including her majestys revenue and customs and to military investigations the ministry of defence police or colloquially mod plod any person with a duty of investigating criminal offences or charging offenders is also required to follow the provisions of the pace codes of practice as far as practical and relevant despite its safeguards pace was extremely controversial on its introduction and reviews have also been controversial as the act was thought to give considerable extra powers to the police with the conjunction of the inland revenue and hm customs and excise into her majestys revenue and customs the hmrc essentially gained extra powers since customs and excise had a statutory right of entry into a private dwelling that is to say they were allowed to break and enter without reason but the inland revenue did not pace and its subsequent enactments limits that various other government agencies including tv licensing the royal mail bt group from its days of being spun off from general post office telephones and about seventeen others also have a statutory right of entry one intent of pace and its successors is to prevent the abuse of this right or remove it entirely to balance the privacy of the individual against the needs of the state

hindu law as a historical term refers to the code of laws applied to hindus buddhists jains and sikhs in british india hindu law in modern scholarship also refers to the legal theory jurisprudence and philosophical reflections on the nature of law found in ancient and medieval era indian texts it is one of the oldest known jurisprudence theories in the world hindu tradition in its surviving ancient texts does not express the law in the canonical sense of ius or of lex the ancient term in indian texts is dharma which means more than a code of law the term hindu law is a colonial construction and emerged after the colonial rule arrived in south asia and when in it was decided by british colonial officials that european common law system would not be implemented in india that hindus of india would be ruled under their hindu law and muslims of india would be ruled under muslim law sharia prior to the british colonial rule muslim law was codified as alamgiri but laws for such as hindus buddhists sikhs jains parsis were not codified during the years of islamic rule the substance of hindu law implemented by the british was derived from a dharmaśāstra named manusmriti one of the many treatises śāstra on dharma the british however mistook the dharmaśāstra as codes of law and failed to recognise that these sanskrit texts were not used as statements of positive law until the british colonial officials chose to do so rather dharmaśāstra contained jurisprudence commentary ie a theoretical reflection upon practical law but not a statement of the law of the land as such scholars have also questioned the authenticity and the corruption in the manusmriti manuscript used to derive the colonial era hindu law in colonial history context the construction and implementation of hindu law and islamic law was an attempt at legal pluralism during the british colonial era where people in the same region were subjected to different civil and criminal laws based on the religion of the plaintiff and defendant legal scholars state that this divided the indian society and that indian law and politics have ever since vacillated between legal pluralism the notion that religion is the basic unit of society and different religions must have different legal rights and obligations and legal universalism the notion that individuals are the basic unit of society and all citizens must have uniform legal rights and obligations in modern india hindus and other in india favor legal universalism that is based not on any hindu text but on parliamentary laws however muslims favor legal pluralism with sharia as the source of marriage divorce and inheritance laws for muslims in india
hospital police are specialized police agencies in the united states that provide law enforcement services and security to hospitals as a result of the increase violence in the healthcare field mental health patients and a wide range of civil disturbances found across the nation hospital security often proved insufficient this occasionally resulted in injury to both the hospital staff and the security officers these hospital security officers were often poorly trained ineffectively led and unprepared to respond to these turbulent and unanticipated events trauma centers treat patients of assaults stabbings and shootings which brings upset family and friends hospitals have the potential for violence on a daily basis creation of hospital police departments began in the across the united states statutory laws were passed and necessary regulations were enacted to provide these security officers with the necessary statutory authority to perform their expanded roles as police officers hospital police officers were required to meet higher training and educational standards by attending the police academy further training was given to these police officers to deal with issues including crisis management the united states department of veterans affairs along with many state and municipal owned hospitals have full service law enforcement agencies while private hospitals usually have special police or constables todays hospital police officers are better equipped to deal with hospital specific issues and have detailed understanding of law enforcement within a healthcare environment

points sometimes also called discount points are a form of interest one point equals one percent of the loan amount by charging a borrower points a lender effectively increases the yield on the loan above the amount of the stated interest rate borrowers can offer to pay a lender points as a method to reduce the interest rate on the loan thus obtaining a lower monthly payment in exchange for this payment in united states for each point purchased the loan rate is typically reduced by anywhere from to selling the property or refinancing prior to this point will result in a net financial loss for the buyer while keeping the loan for longer than this point will result in a net financial savings for the buyer the longer you keep the property financed under the loan with purchased points the more the money spent on the points will pay off accordingly if the intention is to buy and sell the property or refinance in a rapid fashion paying points is actually going to end up costing more than just paying the loan at the higher interest rate points may also be purchased to reduce the monthly payment for the purpose of qualifying for a loan loan qualification based on monthly income versus the monthly loan payment may sometimes only be achievable by reducing the monthly payment through the purchasing of points to buy down the interest rate thereby reducing the monthly loan payment discount points may be different from origination fee or broker fee discount points are always used to buy down the interest rates while origination fees sometimes are fees the lender charges for the loan or sometimes just another name for buying down the interest rate origination fee and discount points are both items listed under on the settlement statement the difference in savings over the life of the loan can make paying points a benefit to the borrower if you intend to stay in your home for an extended period of time it may be worthwhile to pay additional points in order to obtain a lower interest rate any significant changes in fees should be in the final good faith estimate gfe also directly related to points is the concept of the no closing cost loan in which the consumer accepts a higher interest rate in return for the lender paying the loans closing costs up front
in geometry an affine plane is a affine space typical examples of affine planes are euclidean planes which are affine planes over the reals equipped with a metric the euclidean distance in other words an affine plane over the reals is a euclidean plane in which one has forgotten the metric that it one can not talk of lengths nor of angle measures vector spaces of dimension two in which the zero vector is not considered as different from the other elements for every field or division ring f the set of the pairs of elements of f the result of removing any single line and all the points on this line from any projective plane all the affine planes defined over a field are isomorphic more precisely the choice of an affine coordinate system or in the real case a cartesian coordinate system for an affine plane p over a field f induces an isomorphism of affine planes between p and in the more general situation where the affine planes are not defined over a field they will in general not be isomorphic two affine planes arising from the same projective plane by the removal of different lines may not be isomorphic there are two ways to formally define affine planes which are equivalent for affine planes over a field the first one consists in defining an affine plane as a set on which a vector space of dimension two acts simply transitively intuitively this means that an affine plane is a vector space of dimension two in which one has forgotten where is the origin in incidence geometry an affine plane is defined as an abstract system of points and lines satisfying a system of axioms in the applications of mathematics there are often situations where an affine plane without the euclidean metric is used instead of the euclidean plane for example in a graph which can be drawn on paper and in which the position of a particle is plotted against time the euclidean metric is not adequate for its interpretation since the distances between its points or the measures of the angles between its lines have in general no physical importance in the affine plane the axes can use different units which are not comparable and the measures also vary with different units and scales

in mathematical analysis the maxima and minima the respective plurals of maximum and minimum of a function known collectively as extrema the plural of extremum are the largest and smallest value of the function either within a given range the local or relative extrema or on the entire domain of a function the global or absolute extrema pierre de fermat was one of the first mathematicians to propose a general technique adequality for finding the maxima and minima of functions as defined in set theory the maximum and minimum of a set are the greatest and least elements in the set respectively unbounded infinite sets such as the set of real numbers have no minimum or maximum
in mathematical optimization and related fields relaxation is a modeling strategy a relaxation is an approximation of a difficult problem by a nearby problem that is easier to solve a solution of the relaxed problem provides information about the original problem for example a linear programming relaxation of an integer programming problem removes the integrality constraint and so allows rational solutions a lagrangian relaxation of a complicated problem in combinatorial optimization penalizes violations of some constraints allowing an easier relaxed problem to be solved relaxation techniques complement or supplement branch and bound algorithms of combinatorial optimization linear programming and lagrangian relaxations are used to obtain bounds in algorithms for integer programming the modeling strategy of relaxation should not be confused with iterative methods of relaxation such as successive sor iterative methods of relaxation are used in solving problems in differential equations linear and linear programming however iterative methods of relaxation have been used to solve lagrangian relaxations

in mathematics a series is informally speaking the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence the sum of a finite sequence has defined first and last terms whereas a series continues indefinitely given an infinite sequence a series is informally the result of adding all those terms together these can be written more compactly using the summation symbol a value may not always be given to such an infinite sum and in this case the series is said to be divergent on the other hand if the partial sum of the first terms tends to a limit when the number of terms increases indefinitely then the series is said to be convergent and the limit is called the sum of the series an example is the famous series from zenos dichotomy and its mathematical representation which is convergent and whose sum is the terms of the series are often produced according to a rule such as by a formula or by an algorithm to emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms a series is often called an infinite series the study of infinite series is a major part of mathematical analysis series are used in most areas of mathematics even for studying finite structures such as in combinatorics through generating functions in addition to their ubiquity in mathematics infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as physics computer science statistics and finance
a financial forecast is an estimate of future financial outcomes for a company or country for futures and currency markets using historical internal accounting and sales data in addition to external market and economic indicators a financial forecast is an economists best guess of what will happen to a company in financial terms over a given time is usually one year see financial modeling arguably the most difficult aspect of preparing a financial forecast is predicting revenue future costs can be estimated by using historical accounting data variable costs are also a function of sales unlike a financial plan or a budget a financial forecast doesnt have to be used as a planning document outside analysts can use a financial forecast to estimate a companys success in the coming year
in mathematics two variables are proportional if a change in one is always accompanied by a change in the other and if the changes are always related by use of a constant multiplier the constant is called the coefficient of proportionality or proportionality constant if one variable is always the product of the other and a constant the two are said to be directly proportional x and y are directly proportional if the ratio is constant if the product of the two variables is always a constant the two are said to be inversely proportional x and y are inversely proportional if the product xy is constant to express the statement y is directly proportional to x mathematically we write an equation y cx for some real constant c symbolically this is written y x to express the statement y is inversely proportional to x mathematically we write an equation y we can equivalently write y is proportional to which y would represent if a linear function transforms a and b into c and d and if the product a b c d is not zero we say a and b are proportional to c and d an equality of two ratios such as where no term is zero is called a proportion
in mathematics an extreme point of a convex set s in a real vector space is a point in s which does not lie in any open line segment joining two points of s intuitively an extreme point is a vertex of s the theorem states that if s is convex and compact in a locally convex space then s is the closed convex hull of its extreme points in particular such a set has extreme points the theorem is stated for locally convex topological vector spaces the next theorems are stated for banach spaces with the property a theorem of joram lindenstrauss states that in a banach space with the property a closed and bounded set has an extreme point in spaces the property of compactness is stronger than the joint properties of being closed and being bounded a theorem of gerald edgar states that in a banach space with the property a closed and bounded set is the closed convex hull of its extreme points edgars theorem implies lindenstrausss theorem
the return or true rate of return twror is a measure of the historical performance of an investment portfolio which compensates for external flows external flows are net movements of value which result from transfers of cash securities or other instruments into or out of the portfolio with no simultaneous equal and opposite movement of value in the opposite direction as in the case of a purchase or sale and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio such as interest coupons or dividends to compensate for external flows the overall time interval under analysis is divided into contiguous at each point in time within the overall time period whenever there is an external flow in general these will be of unequal lengths the returns over the between external flows are linked geometrically compounded together ie by multiplying together the growth factors in all the the growth factor in each is equal to plus the return over the investment managers are judged on investment activity which is under their control if they have no control over the timing of flows then compensating for the timing of flows using the true return method is a superior measure of the performance of the investment manager

in computational complexity and optimization the no free lunch theorem is a result that states that for certain types of mathematical problems the computational cost of finding a solution averaged over all problems in the class is the same for any solution method no solution therefore offers a short cut in computing there are circumstances in which the outputs of all procedures solving a particular type of problem are statistically identical a colourful way of describing such a circumstance introduced by david wolpert and william g macready in connection with the problems of searchand optimizationis to say that there is no free lunch wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for machine learning statistical inference before wolperts article was published cullen schaffer independently proved a restricted version of one of wolperts theorems and used it to critique the current state of machine learning research on the problem of induction in the no free lunch metaphor each restaurant procedure has a menu associating each lunch plate problem with a price the performance of the procedure in solving the problem the menus of restaurants are identical except in one regard the prices are shuffled from one restaurant to the next for an omnivore who is as likely to order each plate as any other the average cost of lunch does not depend on the choice of restaurant but a vegan who goes to lunch regularly with a carnivore who seeks economy might pay a high average cost for lunch to methodically reduce the average cost one must use advance knowledge of a what one will order and b what the order will cost at various restaurants that is improvement of performance in hinges on using prior information to match procedures to problems in formal terms there is no free lunch when the probability distribution on problem instances is such that all problem solvers have identically distributed results in the case of search a problem instance is an objective function and a result is a sequence of values obtained in evaluation of candidate solutions in the domain of the function for typical interpretations of results search is an optimization process there is no free lunch in search if and only if the distribution on objective functions is invariant under permutation of the space of candidate solutions this condition does not hold precisely in practice but an almost no free lunch theorem suggests that it holds approximately
in mathematics canon arithmeticus is a table of indices and powers with respect to primitive roots for prime powers less than originally published by carl gustav jacob jacobi the tables were at one time used for arithmetical calculations modulo prime powers though like many mathematical tables they have now been replaced by digital computers jacobi also reproduced burkhardts table of the periods of decimal fractions of and ostrogradskys tables of primitive roots of primes less than and gave tables of indices of some odd numbers modulo powers of with respect to the base although the second edition of has jacobis name on the title it has little in common with the first edition apart from the topic the tables were completely recalculated usually with a different choice of primitive root by wilhelm patz jacobis original tables use or or a number with a small power of this form as the primitive root whenever possible while the second edition uses the smallest possible positive primitive root the term canon arithmeticus is occasionally used to mean any table of indices and powers of primitive roots
the simion stoilow institute of mathematics of the romanian academy is a research institute in bucharest romania on december a group of twenty romanian mathematicians from various institutions in bucharest led by dimitrie pompeiu held a meeting at the university of bucharest to establish the institute of mathematical sciences with the aim of promoting scientific research in mathematical sciences through communications talks publications congresses and other means proper to this aim in january they have registered the institute as a legal person specifically an ngo with the ilfov county court on june the new communist regime revamped the romanian academy to an institution modeled on the academy of sciences of the ussr increasing by the number of its member research centers and institutes from to among the newly created institutes was the institute of mathematics of the romanian academy established in on the basis of the previous ngo with the contribution of simion stoilow one of the twenty founding members in in zoia ceauşescu a graduate of the faculty of mathematics of the university of bucharest and the daughter of nicolae ceauşescu the communist head of state was hired by the institute her parents were not happy with her choice in studying mathematics provoked by a verbal disagreement with miron nicolescu in april ceauşescu issued a decree to close down the institute the ensued disruption of normal scientific life led to eventual departure from romania of a number of leading mathematicians including ciprian foias and voiculescu in with contribution from zoia ceauşescu some of the former members of the institute were hired into a newly established mathematical section of the national institute scientific and technical creation institutul national pentru creatie stiintifica si tehnica increst previously known as the institute of fluid mechanics and aerospace research institutul de mecanica fluidelor si cercetari aerospatiale imfca currently a private company inav sa owned by grupul scr after the romanian revolution the institute of mathematics of the romanian academy abbreviated imar was on march by a decree of the romanian government it was placed under the romanian academy itself partially reorganized by a decree of the same government on january currently imar is the leading romanian institution in mathematics research with ca and researchers in the institute was a centre of excellence in research of the european commission since imar has a laboratoire européen associé collaboration with cnrs the institute publishes two scientific journals and organizes many specialized conferences and congresses some of its members are mathematicians imar also hosts theta foundation a independent publisher of scientific mathematical literature and an independent teaching initiative to guide towards research the best romanian students the institute is located on calea griviţei street in downtown bucharest in the same building it had before
the bssn formalism is a formalism of general relativity that was developed by thomas w baumgarte stuart l shapiro masaru shibata and takashi nakamura between and it is a modification of the adm formalism developed during the the adm formalism is a hamiltonian formalism that does not permit stable and numerical simulations in the bssn formalism the adm equations are modified by introducing auxiliary variables the formalism has been tested for a evolution of linear gravitational waves and used for a variety of purposes such as simulating the evolution of gravitational waves or the evolution and collision of black holes

ruppeiner geometry is thermodynamic geometry a type of information geometry using the language of riemannian geometry to study thermodynamics george ruppeiner proposed it in he claimed that thermodynamic systems can be represented by riemannian geometry and that statistical properties can be derived from the model this geometrical model is based on the inclusion of the theory of fluctuations into the axioms of equilibrium thermodynamics namely there exist equilibrium states which can be represented by points on surface manifold and the distance between these equilibrium states is related to the fluctuation between them this concept is associated to probabilities ie the less probable a fluctuation between states the further apart they are this can be recognized if one considers the metric tensor gij in the distance formula line element between the two equilibrium states where the matrix of coefficients gij is the symmetric metric tensor which is called a ruppeiner metric defined as a negative hessian of the entropy function where u is the internal energy mass of the system and na refers to the extensive parameters of the system mathematically the ruppeiner geometry is one particular type of information geometry and it is similar to the metric used in mathematical statistics the ruppeiner metric can be understood as the thermodynamic limit large systems limit of the more general fisher information metric for small systems systems where fluctuations are large the ruppeiner metric may not exist as second derivatives of the entropy are not guaranteed to be the ruppeiner metric is conformally related to the weinhold metric via where t is the temperature of the system under consideration proof of the conformal relation can be easily done when one writes down the first law of thermodynamics in differential form with a few manipulations the weinhold geometry is also considered as a thermodynamic geometry it is defined as a hessian of the internal energy with respect to entropy and other extensive parameters it has long been observed that the ruppeiner metric is flat for systems with noninteracting underlying statistical mechanics such as the ideal gas curvature singularities signal critical behaviors in addition it has been applied to a number of statistical systems including van de waals gas recently the anyon gas has been studied using this approach
the theta model or canonical model is a biological neuron model originally developed to model neurons in the animal aplysia and later used in various fields of computational neuroscience the model is particularly well suited to describe neuron bursting which are rapid oscillations in the membrane potential of a neuron interrupted by periods of relatively little oscillation bursts are often found in neurons responsible for controlling and maintaining steady rhythms for example breathing is controlled by a small network of bursting neurons in the brain stem of the three main classes of bursting neurons square wave bursting parabolic bursting and elliptic bursting the theta model describes parabolic bursting parabolic bursting is characterized by a series of bursts that are regulated by a slower external oscillation this slow oscillation changes the frequency of the faster oscillation so that the frequency curve of the burst pattern resembles a parabola the model has just one state variable which describes the membrane voltage of a neuron in contrast the model consists of four state variables one voltage variable and three gating variables and the model is defined by two state variables one voltage variable and one gating variable the single state variable of the theta model and the elegantly simple equations that govern its behavior allow for analytic or solutions including an explicit expression for the phase response curve the dynamics of the model take place on the unit circle and are governed by two cosine functions and a input function similar models include the quadratic integrate and fire qif model which differs from the theta model by only by a change of variables and plants model which consists of type equations and also differs from the theta model by a series of coordinate transformations despite its simplicity the theta model offers enough complexity in its dynamics that it has been used for a wide range of theoretical neuroscience research as well as in research beyond biology such as in artificial intelligence
a parameter from the ancient greek παρά para beside subsidiary and μέτρον metron measure generally is any characteristic that can help in defining or classifying a particular system meaning an event project object situation etc that is a parameter is an element of a system that is useful or critical when identifying the system or when evaluating its performance status condition etc parameter has more specific meanings within various disciplines including mathematics computing and computer programming engineering statistics logic and linguistics within and across these fields careful distinction must be maintained of the different usages of the term parameter and of other terms often associated with it such as argument property axiom variable function attribute etc
in mathematical logic a gödel numbering is a function that assigns to each symbol and formula of some formal language a unique natural number called its gödel number the concept was used by kurt gödel for the proof of his incompleteness theorems a gödel numbering can be interpreted as an encoding in which a number is assigned to each symbol of a mathematical notation after which a sequence of natural numbers can then represent a sequence of symbols these sequences of natural numbers can again be represented by single natural numbers facilitating their manipulation in formal theories of arithmetic since the publishing of gödels paper in the term gödel numbering or gödel code has been used to refer to more general assignments of natural numbers to mathematical objects
in mathematics the kronecker delta named after leopold kronecker is a function of two variables usually just positive integers the function is if the variables are equal and otherwise where the kronecker delta δij is a piecewise function of variables i and j for example whereas the kronecker delta appears naturally in many areas of mathematics physics and engineering as a means of compactly expressing its definition above in linear algebra the identity matrix i has entries equal to the kronecker delta where i and j take the values and the inner product of vectors can be written as the restriction to positive integers is common but there is no reason it can not have negative integers as well as positive or any discrete rational numbers if i and j above take rational values then for example and but and this latter case is for convenience
in mathematics abelian and tauberian theorems are theorems giving conditions for two methods of summing divergent series to give the same result named after niels henrik abel and alfred tauber the original examples are abels theorem showing that if a series converges to some limit then its abel sum is the same limit and taubers theorem showing that if the abel sum of a series exists and the coefficients are sufficiently small then the series converges to the abel sum more general abelian and tauberian theorems give similar results for more general summation methods there is no clear distinction between abelian and tauberian theorems or even a generally accepted definition of what these terms mean often a theorem is called abelian if it shows that some summation method gives the usual sum for convergent series and is called tauberian if it gives conditions for a series summable by some method to be summable in the usual sense
calculatrivia is a trivia game that was originally made popular in games magazine a set of questions from the obvious to the obscure are posed the answer to each question is a number though not necessarily an integer each of these questions corresponds to a letter of the alphabet in some cases the greek alphabet which get plugged into an algebraic formula creating a final answer in games regular contributor bob lodge created ultimate calculatrivia which took the game to a new level subsequent to that contest a portal for games magazine fans was created online there have been eighteen contests hosted there as of january and there is a community of at least thirty regular contributors
location arithmetic latin arithmeticæ localis is the additive binary numeral systems which john napier explored as a computation technique in his treatise rabdology both symbolically and on a grid napiers terminology derived from using the positions of counters on the board to represent numbers is potentially misleading in current vocabulary because the numbering system is during napiers time most of the computations were made on boards with or jetons so unlike how it may be seen by the modern reader his goal was not to use moves of counters on a board to multiply divide and find square roots but rather to find a way to compute symbolically however when reproduced on the board this new technique did not require mental computations nor complex carry memorization unlike base computations he was so pleased by his discovery that he said in his preface it might be well described as more of a lark than a labor for it carries out addition subtraction multiplication division and the extraction of square roots purely by moving counters from place to place
a posynomial also known as a posinomial in some literature is a function of the form where all the coordinates and coefficients are positive real numbers and the exponents are real numbers posynomials are closed under addition multiplication and nonnegative scaling for example is a posynomial posynomials are not the same as polynomials in several independent variables a polynomials exponents must be integers but its independent variables and coefficients can be arbitrary real numbers on the other hand a posynomials exponents can be arbitrary real numbers but its independent variables and coefficients must be positive real numbers this terminology was introduced by richard j duffin elmor l peterson and clarence zener in their seminal book on geometric programming
the probabilistic method is a nonconstructive method primarily used in combinatorics and pioneered by paul erdős for proving the existence of a prescribed kind of mathematical object it works by showing that if one randomly chooses objects from a specified class the probability that the result is of the prescribed kind is more than zero although the proof uses probability the final conclusion is determined for certain without any possible error this method has now been applied to other areas of mathematics such as number theory linear algebra and real analysis as well as in computer science eg randomized rounding and information theory
in mathematical logic a formal calculation is a calculation which is systematic but without a rigorous justification this means that we are manipulating the symbols in an expression using a generic substitution without proving that the necessary conditions hold essentially we are interested in the form of an expression and not necessarily its underlying meaning this reasoning can either serve as positive evidence that some statement is true when it is difficult or unnecessary to provide a proof or as an inspiration for the creation of new completely rigorous definitions however this interpretation of the term formal is not universally accepted and some consider it to mean quite the opposite a completely rigorous argument as in formal mathematical logic

trajectory optimization is the process of designing a trajectory that minimizes or maximizes some measure of performance while satisfying a set of constraints generally speaking trajectory optimization is a technique for computing an solution to an optimal control problem it is often used for systems where computing the full solution is either impossible or impractical although the idea of trajectory optimization has been around for hundreds of years calculus of variations brachystochrone problem it only became practice for problems with the advent of the computer many of the original applications of trajectory optimization were in the aerospace industry computing rocket and missile launch trajectories more recently trajectory optimization has also been used in a wide variety of industrial process and robotics applications
in quantum mechanics the transform or transform is the invertible mapping between functions in the quantum phase space formulation and hilbert space operators in the schrödinger picture often the mapping from functions on phase space to operators is called the weyl transform whereas the inverse mapping from operators to functions on phase space is called the wigner transform this mapping was originally devised by hermann weyl in in an attempt to map symmetrized classical phase space functions to operators a procedure known as weyl quantization it is now understood that weyl quantization does not satisfy all the properties one would want for quantization and therefore sometimes yields unphysical answers nevertheless in a mathematical sense the transform is a integral transform between the and operator representations and yields insight into the workings of quantum mechanics most importantly the wigner distribution is the wigner transform of the quantum density matrix and conversely the density matrix is the weyl transform of the wigner function in contrast to weyls original intentions in seeking a consistent quantization scheme this map merely amounts to a change of representation within quantum mechanics it need not connect classical with quantum quantities for example the function may depend explicitly on plancks constant ħ as it does in some familiar cases involving angular momentum this invertible representation change then allows one to express quantum mechanics in phase space as was appreciated in the by groenewold and moyal
in the world of finance and investments statistical arbitrage is used in two related but distinct ways in academic literature statistical arbitrage is opposed to deterministic arbitrage in deterministic arbitrage a sure profit can be obtained from being long some securities and short others in statistical arbitrage there is a statistical mispricing of one or more assets based on the expected value of these assets in other words statistical arbitrage conjectures statistical mispricings of price relationships that are true in expectation in the long run when repeating a trading strategy among those who follow the hedge fund industry statistical arbitrage refers to a particular category of hedge funds other categories include global macro convertible arbitrage and so on in this narrower sense statistical arbitrage is often abbreviated as stat arb or statarb according to andrew lo statarb refers to highly technical mean reversion strategies involving large numbers of securities hundreds to thousands depending on the amount of risk capital very short holding periods measured in days to seconds and substantial computational trading and information technology it infrastructure
in finance average price vwap is the ratio of the value traded to total volume traded over a particular time horizon usually one day it is a measure of the average price at which a stock is traded over the trading horizon vwap is often used as a trading benchmark by investors who aim to be as passive as possible in their execution many pension funds and some mutual funds fall into this category the aim of using a vwap trading target is to ensure that the trader executing the order does so with volume on the market it is sometimes argued that such execution reduces transaction costs by minimizing market impact costs the additional cost due to the market impact ie the adverse effect of a traders activities on the price of a security vwap can be measured between any two points in time but is displayed as the one corresponding to elapsed time during the trading day by the information provider vwap is often used in algorithmic trading indeed a broker may guarantee execution of an order at the vwap and have a computer program enter the orders into the market in order to earn the traders commission and create p l this is called a guaranteed vwap execution the broker can also trade in a best effort way and answer to the client the realized price this is called a vwap target execution it incurs more dispersion in the answered price compared to the vwap price for the client but a lower commission trading algorithms that use vwap as a target belong to a class of algorithms known as volume participation algorithms the first known person to implement the vwap calculation as a measurement tool was james elkins head trader at abel noser at the time for the ford motor company in
complex systems biology csb is a branch or subfield of mathematical and theoretical biology concerned with complexity of both structure and function in biological organisms as well as the emergence and evolution of organisms and species with emphasis being placed on the complex interactions of and within bionetworks and on the fundamental relations and relational patterns that are essential to life csb is thus a field of theoretical sciences aimed at discovering and modeling the relational patterns essential to life that has only a partial overlap with complex systems theory and also with the systems approach to biology called systems biology this is because the latter is restricted primarily to simplified models of biological organization and organisms as well as to only a general consideration of philosophical or semantic questions related to complexity in biology moreover a wide range of abstract theoretical complex systems are studied as a field of applied mathematics with or without relevance to biology chemistry or physics

in mathematics economics and computer science the stable marriage problem also stable matching problem or smp is the problem of finding a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordering of preferences for each element a matching is a mapping from the elements of one set to the elements of the other set a matching is not stable if there is an element a of the first matched set which prefers some given element b of the second matched set over the element to which a is already matched and b also prefers a over the element to which b is already matched in other words a matching is stable when there does not exist any match a b by which both a and b would be individually better off than they are with the element to which they are currently matched the stable marriage problem has been stated as follows given men and women where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex in order of preference marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners when there are no such pairs of people the set of marriages is deemed stable note that the existence of two classes that need to be paired with each other men and women in this example distinguishes this problem from the stable roommates problem
the sethi model was developed by suresh p sethi and describes the process of how sales evolve over time in response to advertising the rate of change in sales depend on three effects response to advertising that acts positively on the unsold portion of the market the loss due to forgetting or possibly due to competitive factors that act negatively on the sold portion of the market and a random effect that can go either way suresh sethi published his paper deterministic and stochastic optimization of a dynamic advertising model in the sethi model is a modification as well as a stochastic extension of the advertising model the model and its competitive extensions have been used extensively in the literature moreover some of these extensions have been also tested empirically
the lebombo bone is a baboon fibula with incised markings discovered in the lebombo mountains located between south africa and swaziland changes in the section of the notches indicate the use of different cutting edges which the bones discoverer peter beaumont views as evidence for their having been made like other markings found all over the world during participation in rituals the bone is between and years old according to two dozen radiocarbon datings this is far older than the ishango bone with which it is sometimes confused other notched bones are years old but it is unclear if the notches are merely decorative or if they bear a functional meaning according to the universal book of mathematics the lebombo bones notches suggest it may have been used as a lunar phase counter in which case african women may have been the first mathematicians because keeping track of menstrual cycles requires a lunar calendar but the bone is clearly broken at one end so the notches can only be a minimum number furthermore in the many more notched bones since found there is no consistent notch tally many being in the range
folding home fah or f h is a distributed computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding computational drug design and other types of molecular dynamics the project uses the idle processing resources of thousands of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems its main purpose is to determine the mechanisms of protein folding which is the process by which proteins reach their final structure and to examine the causes of protein misfolding this is of significant academic interest with major implications for medical research into alzheimers disease huntingtons disease and many forms of cancer among other diseases to a lesser extent folding home also tries to predict a proteins final structure and determine how other molecules may interact with it which has applications in drug design folding home is developed and operated by the pande laboratory at stanford university under the direction of prof vijay pande and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world the project has pioneered the use of gpus playstation message passing interface used for computing on processors and some sony xperia smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research the project uses statistical simulation methodology that is a paradigm shift from traditional computational approaches as part of the network architecture the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation work units complete them and return them to the projects database servers where the units are compiled into an overall simulation volunteers can track their contributions on the folding home website which makes volunteers participation competitive and encourages involvement folding home is one of the worlds fastest computing systems with an approximate speed of nearly petaflops this performance from its computing network has allowed researchers to run computationally expensive simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved since its launch on october the pande lab has produced scientific research papers as a direct result of folding home results from the projects simulations agree favorably with experiments
within a set positive numbers a number is small if it is close to zero a number is smaller if it is less than another number within a set of positive and negative numbers there is ambiguity because being closer to zero does not correspond to being less but to being less in absolute value depending on context a negative number may be called smaller if it is closer to zero or if it is more negative this article deals with positive numbers and is also applicable to negative numbers by taking the absolute value small numbers are numbers that are small compared with the numbers used in everyday life very small numbers often occur in fields such as chemistry electronics and quantum physics
the notion of line or straight line was introduced by ancient mathematicians to represent straight objects ie having no curvature with negligible width and depth lines are an idealization of such objects until the century lines were defined in this manner the straight or curved line is the first species of quantity which has only one dimension namely length without any width nor depth and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length exempt of any width the straight line is that which is equally extended between its points euclid described a line as breadthless length which lies equally with respect to the points on itself he introduced several postulates as basic unprovable properties from which he constructed all of geometry which is now called euclidean geometry to avoid confusion with other geometries which have been introduced since the end of century such as projective and affine geometry in modern mathematics given the multitude of geometries the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described for instance in analytic geometry a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation but in a more abstract setting such as incidence geometry a line may be an independent object distinct from the set of points which lie on it when a geometry is described by a set of axioms the notion of a line is usually left undefined a primitive object the properties of lines are then determined by the axioms which refer to them one advantage to this approach is the flexibility it gives to users of the geometry thus in differential geometry a line may be interpreted as a geodesic shortest path between points while in some projective geometries a line is a vector space all linear combinations of two independent vectors this flexibility also extends beyond mathematics and for example permits physicists to think of the path of a light ray as being a line a line segment is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points and contains every point on the line between its end points depending on how the line segment is defined either of the two end points may or may not be part of the line segment two or more line segments may have some of the same relationships as lines such as being parallel intersecting or skew but unlike lines they may be none of these if they are coplanar and either do not intersect or are collinear

optimization also known as programming vector optimization multicriteria optimization multiattribute optimization or pareto optimization is an area of multiple criteria decision making that is concerned with mathematical optimization problems involving more than one objective function to be optimized simultaneously optimization has been applied in many fields of science including engineering economics and logistics see the section on applications for detailed examples where optimal decisions need to be taken in the presence of between two or more conflicting objectives minimizing cost while maximizing comfort while buying a car and maximizing performance whilst minimizing fuel consumption and emission of pollutants of a vehicle are examples of optimization problems involving two and three objectives respectively in practical problems there can be more than three objectives for a nontrivial optimization problem there does not exist a single solution that simultaneously optimizes each objective in that case the objective functions are said to be conflicting and there exists a possibly infinite number of pareto optimal solutions a solution is called nondominated pareto optimal pareto efficient or noninferior if none of the objective functions can be improved in value without degrading some of the other objective values without additional subjective preference information all pareto optimal solutions are considered equally good as vectors can not be ordered completely researchers study optimization problems from different viewpoints and thus there exist different solution philosophies and goals when setting and solving them the goal may be to find a representative set of pareto optimal solutions quantify the in satisfying the different objectives finding a single solution that satisfies the subjective preferences of a human decision maker dm
in mathematics the adjective noetherian is used to describe objects that satisfy an ascending or descending chain condition on certain kinds of subobjects meaning that certain ascending or descending sequences of subobjects must have finite length noetherian objects are named after emmy noether who was the first to study the ascending and descending chain conditions for rings in particular noetherian group a group that satisfies the ascending chain condition on subgroups noetherian ring a ring that satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals noetherian module a module that satisfies the ascending chain condition on submodules more generally an object in a category is said to be noetherian if there is no infinitely increasing filtration of it by subobjects a category is noetherian if every object in it is noetherian noetherian relation a binary relation that satisfies the ascending chain condition on its elements noetherian topological space a topological space that satisfies the descending chain condition on closed sets noetherian induction also called induction a proof method for binary relations that satisfy the descending chain condition noetherian rewriting system an abstract rewriting system that has no infinite chains noetherian scheme a scheme in algebraic geometry that admits a finite covering by open spectra of noetherian rings
the ant on a rubber rope is a mathematical puzzle with a solution that appears counterintuitive or paradoxical it is sometimes given as a worm or inchworm on a rubber or elastic band but the principles of the puzzle remain the same the details of the puzzle can varybut a typical form is as follows an ant starts to crawl along a taut rubber rope km long at a speed of cm per second relative to the rubber it is crawling on at the same time the rope starts to stretch uniformly by km per second so that after second it is km long after seconds it is km long etc will the ant ever reach the end of the rope at first consideration it seems that the ant will never reach the end of the rope but in fact it does although in the form stated above the time taken is colossal whatever the length of the rope and the relative speeds of the ant and the stretching providing the ants speed and the stretching remain steady the ant will always be able to reach the end given sufficient time once the ant has begun moving the rubber rope is stretching both in front of and behind the ant conserving the proportion of the rope already walked by the ant and enabling the ant to make continual progress this is similar to the paradox of achilles and the tortoise
the pruning algorithm is a technique used in digital image processing based on mathematical morphology it is used as a complement to the skeleton and thinning algorithms to remove unwanted parasitic components in this case parasitic components refer to branches of a line which are not key to the overall shape of the line and should be removed these components can often be created by edge detection algorithms or digitisation the standard pruning algorithm will remove all branches shorter than a given number of points the algorithm starts at the end points and recursively removes a given number of points from each branch after this step it will apply dilation on the new end points with a structuring element of s and will intersect the result with the original image if a parasitic branch is shorter than four points and we run the algorithm with the branch will be removed the second step ensures that the main trunks of each line are not shortened by the procedure
in physics canonical quantum gravity is an attempt to quantize the canonical formulation of general relativity or canonical gravity it is a hamiltonian formulation of einsteins general theory of relativity the basic theory was outlined by bryce dewitt in a seminal paper and based on earlier work by peter g bergmann using the canonical quantization techniques for constrained hamiltonian systems invented by paul dirac diracs approach allows the quantization of systems that include gauge symmetries using hamiltonian techniques in a fixed gauge choice newer approaches based in part on the work of dewitt and dirac include the state regge calculus the equation and loop quantum gravity
the tetrad formalism is an approach to general relativity that replaces the choice of a coordinate basis by the less restrictive choice of a local basis for the tangent bundle ie a locally defined set of four linearly independent vector fields called a tetrad in the tetrad formalism all tensors are represented in terms of a chosen basis when generalised to other than four dimensions this approach is given other names see cartan formalism as a formalism rather than a theory it does not make different predictions but does allow the relevant equations to be expressed differently the advantage of the tetrad formalism over the standard approach to general relativity lies in the ability to choose the tetrad basis to reflect important physical aspects of the spacetime the abstract index notation denotes tensors as if they were represented by their coefficients with respect to a fixed local tetrad compared to a completely coordinate free notation which is often conceptually clearer it allows an easy and computationally explicit way to denote contractions
the theory of conjoint measurement also known as conjoint measurement or additive conjoint measurement is a general formal theory of continuous quantity it was independently discovered by the french economist gérard debreu and by the american mathematical psychologist r duncan luce and statistician john tukey the theory concerns the situation where at least two natural attributes a and x relate to a third attribute p it is not required that a x or p are known to be quantities via specific relations between the levels of p it can be established that p a and x are continuous quantities hence the theory of conjoint measurement can be used to quantify attributes in empirical circumstances where it is not possible to combine the levels of the attributes using a operation or concatenation the quantification of psychological attributes such as attitudes cognitive abilities and utility is therefore logically plausible this means that the scientific measurement of psychological attributes is possible that is like physical quantities a magnitude of a psychological quantity may possibly be expressed as the product of a real number and a unit magnitude application of the theory of conjoint measurement in psychology however has been limited it has been argued that this is due to the high level of formal mathematics involved eg and that the theory can not account for the noisy data typically discovered in psychological research eg it has been argued that the rasch model is a stochastic variant of the theory of conjoint measurement eg however this has been disputed eg karabatsos kyngdon order restricted methods for conducting probabilistic tests of the cancellation axioms of conjoint measurement have been developed in the past decade eg karabatsos the theory of conjoint measurement is different but related to conjoint analysis which is a methodology employed in marketing to estimate the parameters of additive utility functions different stimuli are presented to respondents and different methods are used to measure their preferences about the presented stimuli the coefficients of the utility function are estimated using alternative tools
multiple problems are problems containing various conflicting rules and restrictions such problems typically have an optimal solution found by striking a balance between the various restrictions without directly defying any of the aforementioned restrictions solutions to such problems can either require complex thinking processes or can instead require solutions in which an optimal solution is found by setting the various restrictions as equations and finding an appropriate maximum value when all equations are added these problems may thus require more working information as compared to causal relationship problem solving or single problem solving the multiple problem solving is more likely to increase cognitive load than are the other two types of problem solving
in mathematical folklore the no free lunch theorem sometimes pluralized of david wolpert and william macready appears in the no free lunch theorems for optimization wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for machine learning statistical inference in wolpert and macready themselves indicated that the first theorem in their paper state s that any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems the theorems of wolpert and macready are mathematically technical and some find them unintuitive the folkloric no free lunch nfl theorem is an easily stated and easily understood consequence of theorems wolpert and macready actually prove it is weaker than the proven theorems and thus does not encapsulate them various investigators have extended the work of wolpert and macready substantively see no free lunch in search and optimization for treatment of the research area

kinetic proofreading or kinetic amplification is a mechanism for error correction in biochemical reactions proposed independently by john hopfield and jacques ninio kinetic proofreading allows enzymes to discriminate between two possible reaction pathways leading to correct or incorrect products with an accuracy higher than what one would predict based on the difference in the activation energy between these two pathways increased specificity is obtained by introducing an irreversible step exiting the pathway with reaction intermediates leading to incorrect products more likely to prematurely exit the pathway than reaction intermediates leading to the correct product if the exit step is fast relative to the next step in the pathway the specificity can be increased by a factor of up to the ratio between the two exit rate constants if the next step is fast relative to the exit step specificity will not be increased because there will not be enough time for exit to occur this can be repeated more than once to increase specificity further

a surrogate model is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest can not be easily directly measured so a model of the outcome is used instead most engineering design problems require experiments simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as function of design variables for example in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables length curvature material for many real world problems however a single simulation can take many minutes hours or even days to complete as a result routine tasks such as design optimization design space exploration sensitivity analysis and analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations one way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models known as surrogate models response surface models metamodels or emulators that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheaper to evaluate surrogate models are constructed using a approach the exact inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known or even understood solely the behavior is important a model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points this approach is also known as behavioral modeling or modeling though the terminology is not always consistent when only a single design variable is involved the process is known as curve fitting though using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common surrogate modelling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments function evaluations
in the field of digital signal processing the sampling theorem is a fundamental bridge between signals often called analog signals and signals often called digital signals it establishes a sufficient condition for a sample rate that permits a discrete sequence of samples to capture all the information from a signal of finite bandwidth strictly speaking the theorem only applies to a class of mathematical functions having a fourier transform that is zero outside of a finite region of frequencies intuitively we expect that when one reduces a continuous function to a discrete sequence and interpolates back to a continuous function the fidelity of the result depends on the density or sample rate of the original samples the sampling theorem introduces the concept of a sample rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of functions that are bandlimited to a given bandwidth such that no actual information is lost in the sampling process it expresses the sufficient sample rate in terms of the bandwidth for the class of functions the theorem also leads to a formula for perfectly reconstructing the original function from the samples perfect reconstruction may still be possible when the criterion is not satisfied provided other constraints on the signal are known see below and compressed sensingin some cases when the criterion is not satisfied utilizing additional constraints allows for approximate reconstructions the fidelity of these reconstructions can be verified and quantified utilizing bochners theorem the name sampling theorem honors harry nyquist and claude shannon the theorem was also discovered independently by e t whittaker by vladimir kotelnikov and by others it is thus also known by the names and cardinal theorem of interpolation

foundations of mathematics is the study of the logical and philosophical basis of mathematics or in a broader sense the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics in this latter sense the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vaguefoundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts number geometrical figure set function etc and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics formulas theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas definitions proofs algorithms etc also called metamathematical concepts with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics the search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges the foundations of mathematics as a whole does not aim to contain the foundations of every mathematical topicgenerally the foundations of a field of study refers to a systematic analysis of its most basic or fundamental concepts its conceptual unity and its natural ordering or hierarchy of concepts which may help to connect it with the rest of human knowledge the development emergence and clarification of the foundations can come late in the history of a field and may not be viewed by everyone as its most interesting part mathematics always played a special role in scientific thought serving since ancient times as a model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences especially physics mathematics many developments towards higher abstractions in the century brought new challenges and paradoxes urging for a deeper and more systematic examination of the nature and criteria of mathematical truth as well as a unification of the diverse branches of mathematics into a coherent whole the systematic search for the foundations of mathematics started at the end of the century and formed a new mathematical discipline called mathematical logic with strong links to theoretical computer scienceit went through a series of crises with paradoxical results until the discoveries stabilized during the century as a large and coherent body of mathematical knowledge with several aspects or components set theory model theory proof theory etc whose detailed properties and possible variants are still an active research fieldits high level of technical sophistication inspired many philosophers to conjecture that it can serve as a model or pattern for the foundations of other sciences
in mathematics model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures eg groups fields graphs universes of set theory from the perspective of mathematical logic the objects of study are models of theories in a formal language a set of sentences in a formal language is called a theory a model of a theory is a structure eg an interpretation that satisfies the sentences of that theory model theory recognises and is intimately concerned with a duality it examines semantical elements meaning and truth by means of syntactical elements formulas and proofs of a corresponding language to quote the first page of chang and keisler universal algebra logic model theory model theory developed rapidly during the and a more modern definition is provided by wilfrid hodges model theory algebraic geometry fields although model theorists are also interested in the study of fields other nearby areas of mathematics include combinatorics number theory arithmetic dynamics analytic functions and analysis in a similar way to proof theory model theory is situated in an area of interdisciplinarity among mathematics philosophy and computer science the most prominent professional organization in the field of model theory is the association for symbolic logic
finite volume method fvm is a numerical method fvm in computational fluid dynamics is used to solve the partial differential equation which arises from the physical conservation law by using discretisation convection is always followed by diffusion and hence where convection is considered we have to consider combine effect of convection and diffusion but in places where fluid flow plays a role we can neglect the convective effect of the flow in this case we have to consider more simplistic case of only diffusion the general equation for steady can be easily derived from the general transport equation for property by deleting transient general transport equation is defined as where is a conservative form of all fluid flow is density is a net rate of flow of out of fluid element represents convective term is a transient term is a rate of change of due to diffusion is a rate of increase of due to source due to steady state condition transient term becomes zero and due to absence of convection convective term becomes zero therefore steady state dimensional convection and diffusion equation becomes therefore flow should also satisfy continuity equation therefore
the circuit topology of a linear polymer refers to arrangement of its contacts examples of linear polymers with contacts are nucleic acids and proteins for defining the circuit topology contacts are defined depending on the context for proteins with disulfide bonds these bonds could be considered as contacts in a context where interactions in proteins are more relevant these interactions are used to define the circuit topology as such circuit topology framework can be applied to a wide range of applications including protein folding and analysis of genome architecture for a chain with two binary contacts three arrangements are available parallel series and crossed for a chain with contacts the topology can be described by an by matrix in which each element illustrates the relation between a pair of contacts and may take one of the three states p s and x circuit topology relations in a chain with two binary contacts intra chain interactions can often be structurally decomposed into binary interactions and then be subjected to similar analysis circuit topology has implications for folding kinetics and molecular evolution circuit topology along with contact order and size are determinants of folding rate of linear polymers the topology of the cellular proteome and natural rna reflect evolutionary constraints on biomolecular structures topology landscape of biomolecules can be characterized and evolution of molecules can be studied as transition pathways within the landscape
in geometric graph theory the problem named after hugo hadwiger and edward nelson asks for the minimum number of colors required to color the plane such that no two points at distance from each other have the same color the answer is unknown but has been narrowed down to one of the numbers or the correct value may actually depend on the choice of axioms for set theory the question can be phrased in graph theoretic terms as follows let g be the unit distance graph of the plane an infinite graph with all points of the plane as vertices and with an edge between two vertices if and only if the distance between the two points is the problem is to find the chromatic number of g as a consequence the problem is often called finding the chromatic number of the plane by the de theorem a result of the problem is equivalent under the assumption of the axiom of choice to that of finding the largest possible chromatic number of a finite unit distance graph according to the problem was first formulated by e nelson in and first published by had earlier published a related result showing that any cover of the plane by five congruent closed sets contains a unit distance in one of the sets and he also mentioned the problem in a later paper discusses the problem and its history extensively

proof by intimidation or argumentum verbosium is a jocular phrase used mainly in mathematics to refer to a style of presenting a purported mathematical proof by giving an argument loaded with jargon and appeal to obscure results so that the audience is simply obliged to accept it lest they have to admit their ignorance and lack of understanding the phrase is also used when the author is an authority in his field presenting his proof to people who respect a priori his insistence that the proof is valid or when the author claims that his statement is true because it is trivial or because he simply says so usage of this phrase is for the most part in good humour though it also appears in serious criticism proof by intimidation is also cited by critics of junk science to describe cases in which scientific evidence is thrown aside in favour of a litany of tragic individual cases presented to the public by articulate advocates who pose as experts in their field rota claimed in a memoir that the expression proof by intimidation was coined by mark kac to describe a technique used by william feller in his lectures
in logic contraposition is a law that says that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive the contrapositive of the statement has its antecedent and consequent inverted and flipped the contrapositive of is thus for instance the proposition all bats are mammals can be restated as the conditional if something is a bat then it is a mammal now the law says that statement is identical to the contrapositive if something is not a mammal then it is not a bat the contrapositive can be compared with three other relationships between conditional statements inversion the inverse if something is not a bat then it is not a mammal unlike the contrapositive the inverses truth value is not at all dependent on whether or not the original proposition was true as evidenced here the inverse here is clearly not trueconversion the converse if something is a mammal then it is a bat the converse is actually the contrapositive of the inverse and so always has the same truth value as the inverse which is not necessarily the same as that of the original propositionnegation there exists a bat that is not a mammal if the negation is true the original proposition and by extension the contrapositive is false here of course the negation is false note that if is true and we are given that q is false it can logically be concluded that p must be false this is often called the law of contrapositive or the modus tollens rule of inference

in mathematics the method of considering a minimal counterexample combines the ideas of inductive proof and proof by contradiction abstractly in trying to prove a proposition p one assumes that it is false and that therefore there is at least one counterexample with respect to some idea of size which may need to be chosen skillfully one assumes that there is such a counterexample c that is minimal we expect that c is something quite hypothetical since we are trying to prove p but it may be possible to argue that if c existed it would have some definite properties from those we then try to get a contradiction if the form of the contradiction is that we can derive a further counterexample d and that d is smaller than c in the sense of the working hypothesis of minimality then this technique is traditionally called infinite descent there may however be more complicated ways to argue for example the minimal counterexample method has been much used in the classification of finite simple groups the theorem that finite simple groups that are not cyclic groups have even order was based on the hypothesis of some and therefore some minimal simple group g of odd order every proper subgroup of g can be assumed a solvable group meaning that much theory of such subgroups could be applied the assumption that if there is a counterexample there is a minimal counterexample is based on a of some kind the usual ordering on the natural numbers is clearly possible by the most usual formulation of mathematical induction but the scope of the method is induction of any kind euclids proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is a simple proof using a minimal counterexample

exmark is a term describing the relationship between a funds return and the market index the usual designation for this concept is but john c bogle coined this expression to highlight the difference with other financial products for a typical mainstream equity fund the exmark runs from to meaning that an exceedingly high proportion of its total return is explained by the performance of the overall stock market only the remaining of return is explained by some combination of the funds basic strategy and the tactics and investment selections of the funds portfolio manager an exmark below indicates significantly less predictability of relative performance a figure of or above means that a funds return has been shaped predominantly by the action of the stock market itself such a fund may be a closet index fund charging high advisory fees but providing little opportunity to add value over and above the markets return an index fund the return of which is entirely explained by the action of the stock market would of course carry an exmark of
is known as kaprekars constant after the indian mathematician d r kaprekar this number is notable for the following property take any number using at least two different digits leading zeros are allowed arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two numbers adding leading zeros if necessary subtract the smaller number from the bigger number go back to step the above process known as kaprekars routine will always reach its fixed point in at most iterations once is reached the process will continue yielding for example choose the only numbers for which kaprekars routine does not reach are repdigits such as which give the result after a single iteration all other numbers eventually reach if leading zeros are used to keep the number of digits at rather than reaches after iterations rather than reaches after iterations rather than and reach after iterations note that in each iteration of kaprekars routine the two numbers being subtracted one from the other have the same digit sum and hence the same remainder modulo therefore the result of each iteration of kaprekars routine is a multiple of is the equivalent constant for numbers for numbers there is no equivalent constant for any starting number with differing digits the routine enters the loop for each digit length greater than four the routine may terminate at one of several fixed values or may enter one of several loops instead

strips were a computational aid for early crystallographers in calculating fourier transforms to determine the structure of crystals from crystallographic data enabling the creation of models for complex molecules they were used from the until computers with enough power became generally available in the the technique was developed by c arnold beevers reader in crystallography at the university of edinburgh and henry lipson cbe frs professor of physics at the university of manchester institute of science and technology the approach converted the sizable calculations of fourier summations needed in crystallography analysis into sums of more manageable values the folded card strips with numbers were typically stored in two wooden boxes one for sines and one for cosines previously it was necessary to consult tables a process the approach was used by the nobel prize winner dorothy hodgkin om frs the technique is still used in modern computer programs
in mathematics a moment is a specific quantitative measure used in both mechanics and statistics of the shape of a set of points if the points represent mass then the zeroth moment is the total mass the first moment divided by the total mass is the center of mass and the second moment is the rotational inertia if the points represent probability density then the zeroth moment is the total probability ie one the first moment is the mean the second central moment is the variance the third moment is the skewness and the fourth moment with normalization and shift is the kurtosis the mathematical concept is closely related to the concept of moment in physics for a bounded distribution of mass or probability the collection of all the moments of all orders from to uniquely determines the distribution
a chess puzzle is a puzzle in which knowledge of the pieces and rules of chess is used to solve logically a problem the history of chess puzzles reaches back to the middle ages and has evolved since then usually the goal is to find the single best ideally aesthetic move or a series of single best moves in a chess position which was created by a composer or is from a real game but puzzles can also set different objectives examples include deducing the last move played the location of a missing piece or whether a player has lost the right to castle sometimes the objective is antithetical to normal chess such as helping or even compelling the opponent to checkmate ones own king

in mathematics the elasticity or point elasticity of a positive differentiable function f of a positive variable positive input positive output at point a is defined as or equivalently it is thus the ratio of the relative percentage change in the functions output with respect to the relative change in its input for infinitesimal changes from a point equivalently it is the ratio of the infinitesimal change of the logarithm of a function with respect to the infinitesimal change of the logarithm of the argument generalisations to cases also exist in the literature the elasticity of a function is a constant if and only if the function has the form for a constant the elasticity at a point is the limit of the arc elasticity between two points as the separation between those two points approaches zero the concept of elasticity is widely used in economics see elasticity economics for details
in mathematics global analysis also called analysis on manifolds is the study of the global and topological properties of differential equations on manifolds and vector space bundles global analysis uses techniques in manifold theory and topological spaces of mappings to classify behaviors of differential equations particularly nonlinear differential equations these spaces can include singularities and hence catastrophe theory is a part of global analysis optimization problems such as finding geodesics on riemannian manifolds can be solved using differential equations so that the calculus of variations overlaps with global analysis global analysis finds application in physics in the study of dynamical systems and topological quantum field theory
the sign is a mathematical symbol with multiple meanings in mathematics it generally indicates a choice of exactly two possible values one of which is the negation of the other in experimental sciences the sign commonly indicates the confidence interval or error in a measurement often the standard deviation or standard error the sign may also represent an inclusive range of values that a reading might have in engineering the sign indicates the tolerance which is the range of values that are considered to be acceptable safe or which comply with some standard or with a contract in botany it is used in morphological descriptions to notate more or less in chemistry the sign is used to indicate a racemic mixture in chess the sign indicates a clear advantage for the white player the complementary sign indicates the same advantage for the black player the sign is normally pronounced plus or minus
idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application the concept of idempotence arises in a number of places in abstract algebra in particular in the theory of projectors and closure operators and functional programming in which it is connected to the property of referential transparency the term was introduced by benjamin peirce in the context of elements of algebras that remain invariant when raised to a positive integer power and literally means the quality of having the same power from idem potence same power there are several meanings of idempotence depending on what the concept is applied to a unary operation or function is idempotent if whenever it is applied twice to any value it gives the same result as if it were applied once ie ƒƒx ƒx for example the absolute value function where absabsx absx is idempotent given a binary operation an idempotent element or simply an idempotent for the operation is a value for which the operation when given that value for both of its operands gives that value as the result for example the number is an idempotent of multiplication a binary operation is called idempotent if all elements are idempotent elements with respect to the operation in other words whenever it is applied to two equal values it gives that value as the result for example the function giving the maximum value of two equal values is idempotent maxx x x
mathematical induction is a mathematical proof technique most commonly used to establish a given statement for all natural numbers although it can be used to prove statements about any set it is a form of direct proof and it is done in two steps the first step known as the base case is to prove the given statement for the first natural number the second step known as the inductive step is to prove that the given statement for any one natural number implies the given statement for the next natural number from these two steps mathematical induction is the rule from which we infer that the given statement is established for all natural numbers the method can be extended to prove statements about more general structures such as trees this generalization known as structural induction is used in mathematical logic and computer science mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to recursion mathematical induction in some form is the foundation of all correctness proofs for computer programs although its name may suggest otherwise mathematical induction should not be misconstrued as a form of inductive reasoning also see problem of induction mathematical induction is an inference rule used in proofs in mathematics proofs including those using mathematical induction are examples of deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning is excluded from proofs

the step reckoner or stepped reckoner was a digital mechanical calculator invented by the german mathematician gottfried wilhelm leibniz around and completed in the name comes from the translation of the german term for its operating mechanism staffelwalze meaning stepped drum it was the first calculator that could perform all four arithmetic operations its intricate precision gearwork however was somewhat beyond the fabrication technology of the time mechanical problems in addition to a design flaw in the carry mechanism prevented the machines from working reliably two prototypes were built today only one survives in the national library of lower saxony niedersächsische landesbibliothek in hanover germany several later replicas are on display such as the one at the deutsches museum munich despite the mechanical flaws of the stepped reckoner it suggested possibilities to future calculator builders the operating mechanism invented by leibniz called the stepped cylinder or leibniz wheel was used in many calculating machines for years and into the with the curta hand calculator
stochastic volatility models are those in which the variance of a stochastic process is itself randomly distributed they are used in the field of mathematical finance to evaluate derivative securities such as options the name derives from the models treatment of the underlying securitys volatility as a random process governed by state variables such as the price level of the underlying security the tendency of volatility to revert to some mean value and the variance of the volatility process itself among others stochastic volatility models are one approach to resolve a shortcoming of the model in particular models based on assume that the underlying volatility is constant over the life of the derivative and unaffected by the changes in the price level of the underlying security however these models can not explain features of the implied volatility surface such as volatility smile and skew which indicate that implied volatility does tend to vary with respect to strike price and expiry by assuming that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant it becomes possible to model derivatives more accurately

the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics places the position and momentum variables on equal footing in phase space in contrast the schrödinger picture uses the position or momentum representations see also position and momentum space the two key features of the phase space formulation are that the quantum state is described by a quasiprobability distribution instead of a wave function state vector or density matrix and operator multiplication is replaced by a star product the theory was fully developed by hilbrand groenewold in in his phd thesis and independently by joe moyal each building off earlier ideas by hermann weyl and eugene wigner the chief advantage of the phase space formulation is that it makes quantum mechanics appear as similar to hamiltonian mechanics as possible by avoiding the operator formalism thereby freeing the quantization of the burden of the hilbert space this formulation is statistical in nature and offers logical connections between quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics enabling a natural comparison between the two cf classical limit quantum mechanics in phase space is often favored in certain quantum optics applications see optical phase space or in the study of decoherence and a range of specialized technical problems though otherwise the formalism is less commonly employed in practical situations the conceptual ideas underlying the development of quantum mechanics in phase space have branched into mathematical offshoots such as algebraic deformation theory cf kontsevich quantization formula and noncommutative geometry
a mathematical object is an abstract object arising in mathematics the concept is studied in philosophy of mathematics in mathematical practice an object is anything that has been or could be formally defined and with which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs commonly encountered mathematical objects include numbers permutations partitions matrices sets functions and relations geometry as a branch of mathematics has such objects as hexagons points lines triangles circles spheres polyhedra topological spaces and manifolds another groups rings fields lattices and lattices categories are simultaneously homes to mathematical objects and mathematical objects in their own right in proof theory proofs and theorems are also mathematical objects the ontological status of mathematical objects has been the subject of much investigation and debate by philosophers of mathematics
in mathematics a set is a collection of distinct objects considered as an object in its own right for example the numbers and are distinct objects when considered separately but when they are considered collectively they form a single set of size three written sets are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics developed at the end of the century set theory is now a ubiquitous part of mathematics and can be used as a foundation from which nearly all of mathematics can be derived in mathematics education elementary topics such as venn diagrams are taught at a young age while more advanced concepts are taught as part of a university degree the german word menge rendered as set in english was coined by bernard bolzano in his work the paradoxes of the infinite

a mathematical game is a game whose rules strategies and outcomes are defined by clear mathematical parameters often such games have simple rules and match procedures such as and dots and boxes generally mathematical games need not be conceptually intricate to involve deeper computational underpinnings for example even though the rules of mancala are relatively basic the game can be rigorously analyzed through the lens of combinatorial game theory mathematical games differ sharply from mathematical puzzles in that mathematical puzzles require specific mathematical expertise to complete whereas mathematical games do not require a deep knowledge of mathematics to play often the arithmetic core of mathematical games is not readily apparent to players untrained to note the statistical or mathematical aspects some mathematical games are of deep interest in the field of recreational mathematics when studying a games core mathematics arithmetic theory is generally of higher utility than actively playing or observing the game itself to analyze a game numerically it is particularly useful to study the rules of the game insofar as they can yield equations or relevant formulas this is frequently done to determine winning strategies or to distinguish if the game has a solution

in set theory a foundational relation on a set or proper class lets each nonempty subset admit a relational minimal element formally let a r be a binary relation structure where a is a class set or proper class and r is a binary relation defined on a then a r is a foundational relation if and only if any nonempty subset in a has a element in predicate logic in which denotes the empty set and x denotes the class of the elements that precede x in the relation r that is here x is an element in the subset s since none of its is in s
in mathematical finance fugit is the optimal date to exercise an or bermudan option it is useful for hedging purposes here see greeks finance and optimal stopping option trading the term was first introduced by mark garman in an article semper tempus fugit published in the latin term tempus fugit means time flies and garman suggested the name because time flies especially when youre having fun managing your book of american options fugit provides an estimate of when an option would be exercised which is then a useful indication for the maturity to use when hedging american or bermudan products with european options fugit is thus used for the hedging of convertible bonds equity linked convertible notes and any putable or callable exotic coupon notes although see and for qualifications here fugit is also useful in calculating the expected life of the option for employee stock options note the brackets fugit is calculated as the expected time to exercise of american options and is also described as the expected life of the option the computation requires a binomial tree although a finite difference approach would also apply where a second quantity additional to option price is required at each node of the tree see methodology aside note that fugit is not always a unique value nassim taleb proposes a rho fudge as a shortcut method to find the right duration ie expected time to termination for an american option taleb terms this result omega as opposed to fugit the formula is omega nominal duration x of an american option of a european option here refers to sensitivity to dividends or the foreign interest rate as opposed to the more usual rho which measures sensitivity to local interest rates the latter is sometimes used however taleb notes that this approach was widely applied already in the

a signomial is an algebraic function of one or more independent variables it is perhaps most easily thought of as an algebraic extension of extension that permits exponents to be arbitrary real numbers rather than just integers while requiring the independent variables to be strictly positive so that division by zero and other inappropriate algebraic operations are not encountered formally let be a vector of real positive numbers then a signomial function has the form where the coefficients and the exponents are real numbers signomials are closed under addition subtraction multiplication and scaling if we restrict all to be positive then the function f is a posynomial consequently each signomial is either a posynomial the negative of a posynomial or the difference of two posynomials if in addition all exponents are integers then the signomial becomes a polynomial whose domain is the positive orthant for example is a signomial the term signomial was introduced by richard j duffin and elmor l peterson in their seminal joint work on general algebraic in the late and early a recent introductory exposition is optimization problems although nonlinear optimization problems with constraints objectives defined by signomials are normally harder to solve than those defined by only posynomials because unlike posynomials signomials are not guaranteed to be globally convex signomial optimization problems often provide a much more accurate mathematical representation of nonlinear optimization problems
in economics and finance an intertemporal budget constraint is a constraint faced by a decision maker who is making choices for both the present and the future in its general form it says that the present value of current and future cash outflows can not exceed the present value of currently available funds and future cash inflows typically this is expressed as where is expenditure at time t is the cash that becomes available at time t t is the most distant relevant time period is the current time period and is the discount factor computed from the interest rate r complications are possible in various circumstances for example the interest rate for discounting cash receipts might be greater than the interest rate for discounting expenditures because future inflows may be borrowed against while currently available funds may be invested temporarily pending use for future expenditures and borrowing rates may exceed investment returns
in mathematics the multiplicity of a member of a multiset is the number of times it appears in the multiset for example the number of times a given polynomial equation has a root at a given point the notion of multiplicity is important to be able to count correctly without specifying exceptions for example double roots counted twice hence the expression counted with multiplicity if multiplicity is ignored this may be emphasized by counting the number of distinct elements as in the number of distinct roots however whenever a set as opposed to multiset is formed multiplicity is automatically ignored without requiring use of the term distinct

ascend is a free open source mathematical modelling system developed at carnegie mellon university since late ascend is an acronym which stands for advanced system for computations in engineering design its main uses have been in the field of chemical process modelling although its capabilities are general it was a pioneering piece of software in the chemical process modelling field with its novel modelling language conventions and powerful solver although it has never been commercialized and remains as an open source software project ascend includes nonlinear algebraic solvers equation solvers nonlinear optimization and modelling of conditional models its matrix operations are supported by an efficient sparse matrix solver called mtx ascend differs from earlier modelling systems because it separates the solving strategy from model building so domain experts people writing the models and computational engineers people writing the solver code can work separately in developing ascend together with a number of other early modelling tools its architecture helped to inspire newer languages such as modelica it was recognised for its flexible use of variables and parameters which it always treats as solvable if desired the software remains as an active software project and has been part of the google summer of code programme in under python software foundation and has been accepted for the programme as well
is a proposal from donald knuth for the terminology and symbols of an alternate decimal superbase system in it he adapts the familiar english terms for large numbers to provide a systematic set of names for much larger numbers in addition to providing an extended range also dodges the long and short scale ambiguity of knuths digit grouping is exponential instead of linear each division doubles the number of digits handled whereas the familiar system only adds three or six more his system is basically the same as one of the ancient and chinese numeral systems in which units stand for and so on today the corresponding characters are used for and so on
infinity symbol is an abstract concept describing something without any bound or larger than any number philosophers have speculated about the nature of the infinite such as zeno of elea who proposed many paradoxes involving infinity and eudoxus of cnidus who used the idea of infinitely small quantities in his method of exhaustion modern mathematics uses the concept of infinity in the solution of many practical and theoretical problems such as in calculus and set theory and the idea also is used in physics and the other sciences in mathematics infinity is often treated as a number ie it counts or measures things an infinite number of terms but it is not the same sort of number as natural or real numbers georg cantor formalized many ideas related to infinity and infinite sets during the late and early centuries in the theory he developed there are infinite sets of different sizes called cardinalities for example the set of integers is countably infinite while the infinite set of real numbers is uncountable
financial engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving financial theory the methods of engineering the tools of mathematics and the practice of programming it has also been defined as the application of technical methods especially from mathematical finance and computational finance in the practice of finance despite its name financial engineering does not belong to any of the fields in traditional engineering even though many financial engineers have studied engineering beforehand and many universities offering a postgraduate degree in this field require applicants to have a background in engineering as well in the united states the accreditation board for engineering and technology abet does not accredit financial engineering degrees in the united states financial engineering programs are accredited by the international association of quantitative finance financial engineering draws on tools from applied mathematics computer science statistics and economic theory in broadest definition anyone who uses technical tools in finance could be called a financial engineer for example any computer programmer in a bank or any statistician in a government economic bureau however most practitioners restrict the term to someone educated in the full range of tools of modern finance and whose work is informed by financial theory it is sometimes restricted even further to cover only those originating new financial products and strategies financial engineering plays a key role in the derivatives business which encompasses quantitative modelling and programming trading and risk managing derivative products in compliance with the regulations and basel requirements
in mathematics the subderivative subgradient and subdifferential generalize the derivative to functions which are not differentiable the subdifferential of a function is subderivatives arise in convex analysis the study of convex functions often in connection to convex optimization let f be a convex function defined on an open interval of the real line such a function need not be differentiable at all points for example the absolute value function is nondifferentiable when however as seen in the picture on the right for any in the domain of the function one can draw a line which goes through the point and which is everywhere either touching or below the graph of f the slope of such a line is called a subderivative because the line is under the graph of f
richard dick levins june january was an farmer turned ecologist a population geneticist biomathematician mathematical ecologist and philosopher of science who had researched diversity in human populations until his death levins was a university professor at the harvard th chan school of public health and a political activist he was best known for his work on evolution and complexity in changing environments and on metapopulations file mathmodelsvg levins writing and speaking is extremely condensed this combined with his marxism has made his analyses less than those of some other ecologists and evolutionists who were adept at popularization one story of his chicago years is that in order to understand his lectures his graduate students each needed to attend levins courses three times the first time to acclimate themselves to the speed of his delivery and the difficulty of his mathematics the second to get the basic ideas down and the third to pick up his subtleties and profundities levins also had written on philosophical issues in biology and modelling one of his influential articles is the strategy of model building in population biology he has influenced a number of contemporary philosophers of biology levins often boasted publicly that he was a fourth generation marxist and often had said that the methodology in his evolution in changing environments was based upon the introduction to marxs grundrisse the rough draft of das kapital with the evolutionary geneticist richard lewontin levins had written a number of articles on methodology philosophy and social implications of biology many of these are collected in the dialectical biologist in the duo published a second thematic collection of essays titled biology under the influence dialectical essays on ecology agriculture and health also with lewontin levins had a number of satirical articles criticizing sociobiology systems modeling in ecology and other topics under the pseudonym isadore nabi levins and lewontin managed to place a ridiculous biography of nabi and his achievements in american men of science thereby showing how little editorial care and work went on in that respected reference work
in physics the cg coefficients are numbers that arise in angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics they appear as the expansion coefficients of total angular momentum eigenstates in an uncoupled tensor product basis in more mathematical terms the cg coefficients are used in representation theory particularly of compact lie groups to perform the explicit direct sum decomposition of the tensor product of two irreducible representations ie a reducible representation into irreducible representations in cases where the numbers and types of irreducible components are already known abstractly the name derives from the german mathematicians alfred clebsch and paul gordan who encountered an equivalent problem in invariant theory from a vector calculus perspective the cg coefficients associated with the group can be defined simply in terms of integrals of products of spherical harmonics and their complex conjugates the addition of spins in terms can be read directly from this approach as spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of total angular momentum and projection thereof onto an axis and the integrals correspond to the hilbert space inner product from the formal definition of angular momentum recursion relations for the coefficients can be found there also exist complicated explicit formulas for their direct calculation the formulas below use diracs notation and the phase convention is adopted
the elimination algorithm dee is a method for minimizing a function over a discrete set of independent variables the basic idea is to identify dead ends ie combinations of variables that are not necessary to define a global minimum because there is always a way of replacing such combination by a better or equivalent one then we can refrain from searching such combinations further hence elimination is a mirror image of dynamic programming in which good combinations are identified and explored further although the method itself is general it has been developed and applied mainly to the problems of predicting and designing the structures of proteins it closely related to the notion of dominance in optimization also known as substitutability in a constraint satisfaction problem the original description and proof of the elimination theorem can be found in
in the design of experiments optimal designs or optimum designs are a class of experimental designs that are optimal with respect to some statistical criterion the creation of this field of statistics has been credited to danish statistician kirstine smith in the design of experiments for estimating statistical models optimal designs allow parameters to be estimated without bias and with minimum variance a design requires a greater number of experimental runs to estimate the parameters with the same precision as an optimal design in practical terms optimal experiments can reduce the costs of experimentation the optimality of a design depends on the statistical model and is assessed with respect to a statistical criterion which is related to the of the estimator specifying an appropriate model and specifying a suitable criterion function both require understanding of statistical theory and practical knowledge with designing experiments
mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics it bears close connections to metamathematics the foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science the unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory model theory recursion theory and proof theory these areas share basic results on logic particularly logic and definability in computer science particularly in the acm classification mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article see logic in computer science for those since its inception mathematical logic has both contributed to and has been motivated by the study of foundations of mathematics this study began in the late century with the development of axiomatic frameworks for geometry arithmetic and analysis in the early century it was shaped by david hilberts program to prove the consistency of foundational theories results of kurt gödel gerhard gentzen and others provided partial resolution to the program and clarified the issues involved in proving consistency work in set theory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can be formalized in terms of sets although there are some theorems that can not be proven in common axiom systems for set theory contemporary work in the foundations of mathematics often focuses on establishing which parts of mathematics can be formalized in particular formal systems as in reverse mathematics rather than trying to find theories in which all of mathematics can be developed
the nk model is a mathematical model described by its primary inventor stuart kauffman as a tunably rugged fitness landscape tunable ruggedness captures the intuition that both the overall size of the landscape and the number of its local hills and valleys can be adjusted via changes to its two parameters and defined below the nk model has found application in a wide variety of fields including the theoretical study of evolutionary biology immunology optimisation and complex systems the model was also adopted in organizational theory where it is used to describe the way an agent may search a landscape by manipulating various characteristics of itself for example an agent can be an organization the hills and valleys represent profit or changes thereof and movement on the landscape necessitates organizational decisions such as adding product lines or altering the organizational structure which tend to interact with each other and affect profit in a complex fashion an early version of the model which considered only the smoothest and most rugged landscapes was presented in kauffman and levin the model as it is currently known first appeared in kauffman and weinberger one of the reasons why the model has attracted wide attention in optimisation is that it is a particularly simple instance of a problem
in geometry the paper bag problem or teabag problem is to calculate the maximum possible inflated volume of an initially flat sealed rectangular bag which has the same shape as a cushion or pillow made out of two pieces of material which can bend but not stretch according to anthony c robin an approximate formula for the capacity of a sealed expanded bag is where w is the width of the bag the shorter dimension h is the height the longer dimension and v is the maximum volume the approximation ignores the crimping round the equator of the bag a very rough approximation to the capacity of a bag that is open at one edge is this latter formula assumes that the corners at the bottom of the bag are linked by a single edge and that the base of the bag is not a more complex shape such as a lens
james clerk maxwell frs frse june november was a scottish scientist in the field of mathematical physics his most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation bringing together for the first time electricity magnetism and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon maxwells equations for electromagnetism have been called the second great unification in physics after the first one realised by isaac newton with the publication of a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field in maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena the unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves maxwell helped develop the distribution a statistical means of describing aspects of the kinetic theory of gases he is also known for presenting the first durable colour photograph in and for his foundational work on analysing the rigidity of frameworks trusses like those in many bridges his discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics many physicists regard maxwell as the scientist having the greatest influence on physics his contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of isaac newton and albert einstein in the millennium survey of the most prominent was voted the third greatest physicist of all time behind only newton and einstein on the centenary of maxwells birthday einstein described maxwells work as the most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of newton
in mathematical logic a theory is complete if all the formulas or its negations are demonstrablerecursively axiomatizable theories that are rich enough to allow general mathematical reasoning to be formulated can not be complete as demonstrated by gödels incompleteness theorem this sense of complete is distinct from the notion of a complete logic which asserts that for every theory that can be formulated in the logic all semantically valid statements are provable theorems for an appropriate sense of semantically valid gödels completeness theorem is about this latter kind of completeness complete theories are closed under a number of conditions internally modelling the for a set if and only if and for a set if and only if or maximal consistent sets are a fundamental tool in the model theory of classical logic and modal logic their existence in a given case is usually a straightforward consequence of zorns lemma based on the idea that a contradiction involves use of only finitely many premises in the case of modal logics the collection of maximal consistent sets extending a theory t closed under the necessitation rule can be given the structure of a model of t called the canonical model
in finance a lattice model is a technique applied to the valuation of derivatives where a discrete time model is required for equity options a typical example would be pricing an american option where a decision as to option exercise is required at all times any time before and including maturity a continuous model on the other hand such as black scholes would only allow for the valuation of european options where exercise is on the options maturity date for interest rate derivatives lattices are additionally useful in that they address many of the issues encountered with continuous models such as pull to par the method is also used for valuing certain exotic options where because of path dependence in the payoff monte carlo methods for option pricing fail to account for optimal decisions to terminate the derivative by early exercise
rigorous analysis rcwa is a method in computational electromagnetics that is most typically applied to solve scattering from periodic dielectric structures it is a method so devices and fields are represented as a sum of spatial harmonics the method is based on the floquets theorem that the solutions of periodic differential equations can be expanded with floquet functions or sometimes referred as bloch wave especially in physics community a device is divided into layers that are each uniform in the z direction a staircase approximation is needed for curved devices with properties such as dielectric permittivity graded along the the electromagnetic modes in each layer are calculated and analytically propagated through the layers the overall problem is solved by matching boundary conditions at each of the interfaces between the layers using a technique like scattering matrices to solve for the electromagnetic modes which are decided by the wave vector of the incident plane wave in periodic dielectric medium the maxwells equations in partial differential form as well as the boundary conditions are expanded by the floquet functions and turned into infinitely large algebraic equations with the cutting off of higher order floquet functions depending on the accuracy and convergence speed one needs the infinitely large algebraic equations become finite and thus solvable by computers being a method it suffers several drawbacks gibbs phenomenon is particularly severe for devices with high dielectric contrast truncating the number of spatial harmonics can also slow convergence and techniques like fast fourier factorization fff should be used fff is straightforward to implement for gratings but the community is still working on a straightforward approach for crossed grating devices the difficulty with fff in crossed grating devices is that the field must be decomposed into parallel and perpendicular components at all of the interfaces this is not a straightforward calculation for arbitrarily shaped devices boundary conditions must be enforced at the interfaces between all the layers when many layers are used this becomes too large to solve simultaneously instead we borrow from network theory and calculate scattering matrices this lets us solve the boundary conditions one layer at a time almost without exception however the scattering matrices implemented for rcwa are inefficient and do not follow long standing conventions in terms of how and are defined a paper was recently published that identified this problem and presented a correct and efficient formulation of scattering matrices for both rcwa and the method of lines see other methods exist like the enhanced transmittance matrices etm r matrices h matrices and probably more etm for example is considerably faster but less memory efficient
domineering also called or crosscram is a mathematical game played on a sheet of graph paper with any set of designs traced out for example it can be played on a square a checkerboard an entirely irregular polygon or any combination thereof two players have a collection of dominoes which they place on the grid in turn covering up squares one player left plays tiles vertically while the other right plays horizontally as in most games in combinatorial game theory the first player who can not move loses domineering is a partisan game in that players use different pieces the impartial version of the game is cram

the algorithm is a numerical method for solving basis pursuit denoising quickly faster than any other algorithm for large sparse problems basis pursuit denoising is the following optimization problem where is the observed signal is the sparse signal to be recovered is the expected signal under and is the regularization parameter trading off signal fidelity and simplicity it consists of the following declare to be so the unexplained residual declare the active set to be the empty set calculate the usefulness for each component in if on no terminate otherwise add components to based on their usefulness solve basis pursuit denoising exactly on and throw out any component of whose value attains exactly this problem is dense so quadratic programming techniques work very well for this sub problem update nb can be computed in the subproblem as all elements outside of are go to step since every time the algorithm performs a global search it adds up to components to the active set it can be a factor of faster than the best alternative algorithms when this search is computationally expensive a theorem guarantees that the global optimum is reached in spite of the nature of the algorithm
in mathematics and logic a direct proof is a way of showing thetruth or falsehood of a given statement by a straightforward combination ofestablished facts usually axioms existing lemmas and theorems without making any further assumptions in order to directly prove a conditional statement of the form if p then q it suffices to consider the situations in which the statement p is true logical deduction is employed to reason from assumptions to conclusion the type of logic employed is almost invariably logic employing the quantifiers for all and there exists common proof rules used are modus ponens and universal instantiation in contrast an indirect proof may begin with certain hypothetical scenarios and then proceed to eliminate the uncertainties in each of these scenarios until an inescapable conclusion is forced for example instead of showing directly p q one proves its contrapositive one assumes and shows that it leads to since p q and are equivalent by the principle of transposition see law of excluded middle p q is indirectly proved proof methods that are not direct include proof by contradiction including proof by infinite descent direct proof methods include proof by exhaustion and proof by induction
in physics the supersymmetric wkb swkb approximation is an extension of the wkb approximation that uses principles from supersymmetric quantum mechanics to provide estimations on energy eigenvalues in systems using the supersymmetric method there are potentials that can be expressed in terms of a superpotential such that the swkb approximation then writes the quantization condition from the wkb approximation in terms of the swkb approximation for unbroken supersymmetry to first order in is given by where is the estimate of the energy of the excited state and and are the classical turning points given by the addition of the supersymmetric method provides several appealing qualities to this method first it is known that by construction the ground state energy will be exactly estimated this is an improvement over the standard wkb approximation which often has weaknesses at lower energies another property is that a class of potentials known as shape invariant potentials have their energy spectra estimated exactly by this condition
in mathematical analysis and applications in geometry applied mathematics engineering and natural sciences a function of a real variable is a function whose domain is the real numbers ℝ more specifically the subset of ℝ for which the function is defined the output also called the value of the function could be anything simple examples include a single real number or a vector of real numbers the function is vector valued functions of a single real variable occur widely in applied mathematics and physics particularly in classical mechanics of particles as well as phase paths of dynamical systems but we could also have a matrix of real numbers as the output the function is matrix valued and so on the output could also be other number fields such as complex numbers quaternions or even more exotic hypercomplex numbers
the tombstone halmos end of proof or qed mark is used in mathematics to denote the end of a proof in place of the traditional abbreviation qed for the latin phrase quod erat demonstrandum which was to be shown in magazines it is one of the various symbols used to indicate the end of an article in unicode it is represented as character end of proof html its graphic form varies it may be a hollow or filled rectangle or square in the symbol is automatically appended at the end of a proof environment begin proof end proof it can also be obtained from the commands qedsymbol or qed the latter causes the symbol to be right aligned it is sometimes called a halmos after the mathematician paul halmos who first used it in mathematical context he got the idea of using it from seeing it was being used to indicate the end of articles in magazines in his memoir i want to be a mathematician he wrote the following the symbol is definitely not my invention it appeared in popular magazines not mathematical ones before i adopted it but once again i seem to have introduced it into mathematics it is the symbol that sometimes looks like and is used to indicate an end usually the end of a proof it is most frequently called the tombstone but at least one generous author referred to it as the halmos
mathematical finance also known as quantitative finance is a field of applied mathematics concerned with financial markets generally mathematical finance will derive and extend the mathematical or numerical models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory taking observed market prices as input mathematical consistency is required not compatibility with economic theory thus for example while a financial economist might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain share price a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given and attempt to use stochastic calculus to obtain the corresponding value of derivatives of the stock see valuation of options financial modeling the fundamental theorem of pricing is one of the key theorems in mathematical finance while the equation and formula are amongst the key results mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the fields of computational finance and financial engineering the latter focuses on applications and modeling often by help of stochastic asset models see quantitative analyst while the former focuses in addition to analysis on building tools of implementation for the models in general there exist two separate branches of finance that require advanced quantitative techniques derivatives pricing on the one hand and and portfolio management on the other many universities offer degree and research programs in mathematical finance see master of mathematical finance
in mathematical logic two theories are equiconsistent if the consistency of one theory implies the consistency of the other theory and vice versa in this case they are roughly speaking as consistent as each other in general it is not possible to prove the absolute consistency of a theory t instead we usually take a theory s believed to be consistent and try to prove the weaker statement that if s is consistent then t must also be we can do this we say that t is consistent relative to s if s is also consistent relative to t then we say that s and t are equiconsistent
in mathematics specifically in algebraic topology the axioms are properties that homology theories of topological spaces have in common the quintessential example of a homology theory satisfying the axioms is singular homology developed by samuel eilenberg and norman steenrod one can define a homology theory as a sequence of functors satisfying the axioms the axiomatic approach which was developed in allows one to prove results such as the sequence that are common to all homology theories satisfying the axioms if one omits the dimension axiom described below then the remaining axioms define what is called an extraordinary homology theory extraordinary cohomology theories first arose in and cobordism
nearest neighbor search nns also known as proximity search similarity search or closest point search is an optimization problem for finding closest or most similar points closeness is typically expressed in terms of a dissimilarity function the less similar the objects the larger the function values formally the nn search problem is defined as follows given a set s of points in a space m and a query point q m find the closest point in s to q donald knuth in vol of the art of computer programming called it the problem referring to an application of assigning to a residence the nearest post office a direct generalization of this problem is a search where we need to find the k closest points most commonly m is a metric space and dissimilarity is expressed as a distance metric which is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality even more common m is taken to be the vector space where dissimilarity is measured using the euclidean distance manhattan distance or other distance metric however the dissimilarity function can be arbitrary one example are asymmetric bregman divergences for which the triangle inequality does not hold
in general relativity newtonian gauge is a perturbed form of the line element the gauge freedom of general relativity is used to eliminate two scalar degrees of freedom of the metric so that it can be written as where the latin indices a and b are summed over the spatial directions and is the kronecker delta conformal newtonian gauge is the closely related gauge in which which is related by the simple transformation these metrics are perturbed forms of the metric they are called newtonian gauge because is the newtonian gravitational potential of classical newtonian gravity which satisfies the poisson equation for matter and on scales where the expansion of the universe may be neglected it includes only scalar perturbations of the metric by the decomposition these evolve independently of the vector and tensor perturbations and are the predominant ones affecting the growth of structure in the universe in cosmological perturbation theory the vector perturbations vanish in cosmic inflation and the tensor perturbations are gravitational waves which have a negligible effect on physics except for the of the cosmic microwave background polarization the tensor perturbation is truly gauge independent since it is the same in all gauges in a universe without anisotropic stress that is where the tensor is invariant under spatial rotations or the three principal pressures are identical the einstein equation sets
a pentomino is a plane geometric figure formed by joining five equal squares edge to edge it is a polyomino with five cells there are twelve pentominoes not counting rotations and reflections as distinct they are used chiefly in recreational mathematics for puzzles and problems ordinarily the pentomino obtained by reflecting or rotating a pentomino does not count as a different pentomino the f l p y and z pentominoes are chiral adding their reflections f j q y s brings the number of pentominoes to pentominoes i t u v w and x remain the same when reflected this matters in some video games in which the pieces may not be reflected such as tetris imitations and rampart each of the twelve pentominoes satisfies the conway criterion hence every pentomino is capable of tiling the plane each chiral pentomino can tile the plane without reflecting it
in mathematics an elliptic boundary value problem is a special kind of boundary value problem which can be thought of as the stable state of an evolution problem for example the dirichlet problem for the laplacian gives the eventual distribution of heat in a room several hours after the heating is turned on differential equations describe a large class of natural phenomena from the heat equation describing the evolution of heat in for instance a metal plate to the equation describing the movement of fluids including einsteins equations describing the physical universe in a relativistic way although all these equations are boundary value problems they are further subdivided into categories this is necessary because each category must be analyzed using different techniques the present article deals with the category of boundary value problems known as linear elliptic problems boundary value problems and partial differential equations specify relations between two or more quantities for instance in the heat equation the rate of change of temperature at a point is related to the difference of temperature between that point and the nearby points so that over time the heat flows from hotter points to cooler points boundary value problems can involve space time and other quantities such as temperature velocity pressure magnetic field etc some problems do not involve time for instance if one hangs a clothesline between the house and a tree then in the absence of wind the clothesline will not move and will adopt a gentle hanging curved shape known as the catenary this curved shape can be computed as the solution of a differential equation relating position tension angle and gravity but since the shape does not change over time there is no time variable elliptic boundary value problems are a class of problems which do not involve the time variable and instead only depend on space variables it is not possible to discuss elliptic boundary value problems in more detail without referring to calculus in multiple variables unless otherwise noted all facts presented in this article can be found in

the monty hall problem is a brain teaser in the form of a probability puzzle loosely based on the american television game show lets make a deal and named after its original host monty hall the problem was originally posed in a letter by steve selvin to the american statistician in it became famous as a question from a readers letter quoted in marilyn vos savants ask marilyn column in parade magazine in suppose youre on a game show and youre given the choice of three doors behind one door is a car behind the others goats you pick a door say no and the host who knows whats behind the doors opens another door say no which has a goat he then says to you do you want to pick door no is it to your advantage to switch your choice vos savants response was that the contestant should switch to the other door under the standard assumptions contestants who switch have a chance of winning the car while contestants who stick to their initial choice have only a chance the given probabilities depend on specific assumptions about how the host and contestant choose their doors a key insight is that under these standard conditions there is more information about doors and that was not available at the beginning of the game when the door was chosen by the player the hosts deliberate action adds value to the door he did not choose to eliminate but not to the one chosen by the contestant originally another insight is that switching doors is a different action than choosing between the two remaining doors at random as the first action uses the previous information and the latter does not other possible behaviors than the one described can reveal different additional information or none at all and yield different probabilities many readers of vos savants column refused to believe switching is beneficial despite her explanation after the problem appeared in parade approximately readers including nearly with phds wrote to the magazine most of them claiming vos savant was wrong even when given explanations simulations and formal mathematical proofs many people still do not accept that switching is the best strategy paul erdős one of the most prolific mathematicians in history remained unconvinced until he was shown a computer simulation confirming the predicted result the problem is a paradox of the veridical type because the correct result you should switch doors is so counterintuitive it can seem absurd but is nevertheless demonstrably true the monty hall problem is mathematically closely related to the earlier three prisoners problem and to the much older bertrands box paradox

in mathematics a harmonic progression or harmonic sequence is a progression formed by taking the reciprocals of an arithmetic progression in other words it is a sequence of the form where is not a natural number and k is a natural number terms in the form can be expressed as we can let and equivalently a sequence is a harmonic progression when each term is the harmonic mean of the neighboring terms it is not possible for a harmonic progression other than the trivial case where a and k to sum to an integer the reason is that necessarily at least one denominator of the progression will be divisible by a prime number that does not divide any other denominator
in many contexts in mathematics the term inverse indicates the opposite of something this word and its derivatives are used widely in mathematics as illustrated below inverse element of an element x with respect to a binary operation with identity element e is an element y such that x y y x e in particular the additive inverse of x is the multiplicative inverse or reciprocal of x is inverse function inverse element with respect to function composition a function that reverses the action of a given function x inversion in a point a geometric transform circle inversion another particular geometric transformation of a plane that maps the outside of a circle to the inside and vice versa inverse limit a notion in abstract algebra inverse logic is the inverse of p q inverse matrix inverse element with respect to matrix multiplication pseudoinverse a generalization of the inverse matrix inverse proportion also inversely proportional a relationship between two variables x and y characterized by the equation inverse problem the task of identifying model parameters from observed data see for example inverse scattering problem inverse kinematics inverse dynamics inverse perspective the further the objects the larger they are drawn inverse semigroup inverse of an element in a semigroup law the magnitude of a force is proportional to the inverse square of the distance inverse transform sampling generate some random numbers according to a given probability distribution inverse chain rule method related to integration and differentiation inversion of elements a pair of adjacent elements of a permutation viewed as a list inverse relation inversion transformation an extension of poincaré transformation in set theory the inverse of a set is called complement set theory
in classical mechanics the shell theorem gives gravitational simplifications that can be applied to objects inside or outside a spherically symmetrical body this theorem has particular application to astronomy isaac newton proved the shell theorem and stated that a spherically symmetric body affects external objects gravitationally as though all of its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre if the body is a spherically symmetric shell ie a hollow ball no net gravitational force is exerted by the shell on any object inside regardless of the objects location within the shell a corollary is that inside a solid sphere of constant density the gravitational force varies linearly with distance from the centre becoming zero by symmetry at the centre of mass this is easy to see take a point within such a sphere at a distance from the centre of the sphere then you can ignore all the shells of greater radius by the shell theorem so the remaining mass is proportional to and the gravitational force exerted on it is proportional to so to so is linear in these results were important to newtons analysis of planetary motion they are not immediately obvious but they can be proven with calculus alternatively gausss law for gravity offers a much simpler way to prove the same results in addition to gravity the shell theorem can also be used to describe the electric field generated by a static spherically symmetric charge density or similarly for any other phenomenon that follows an inverse square law the derivations below focus on gravity but the results can easily be generalized to the electrostatic force moreover the results can be generalized to the case of general ellipsoidal bodies

the promptuary was a calculating machine invented by the scottish mathematician john napier and described in the second edition of his book rabdologiae in which he also described napiers bones it is an extension of napiers bones using two sets of rods to achieve multiplication the rods for the multiplicand are similar to napiers bones with repetitions of the values the set of rods for the multiplier are shutters or masks for each digit placed over the multiplicand rods the results are then tallied from the digits showing as with other lattice multiplication methods the final form described by napier took advantage of symmetries to compact the rods and used the materials of the day to hold system of metal plates placed inside a wooden frame
in the mathematical field of probability the wiener sausage is a neighborhood of the trace of a brownian motion up to a time t given by taking all points within a fixed distance of brownian motion it can be visualized as a sausage of fixed radius whose centerline is brownian motion the wiener sausage was named after norbert wiener by m d donsker and s r srinivasa varadhan because of its relation to the wiener process the name is also a pun on vienna sausage as wiener means viennese in german the wiener sausage is one of the simplest functionals of brownian motion its applications include stochastic phenomena including heat conduction it was first described by frank spitzer and it was used by mark kac and joaquin mazdak luttinger to explain results of a condensate with proofs published by m d donsker and s r srinivasa varadhan
mathematical morphology mm is a theory and technique for the analysis and processing of geometrical structures based on set theory lattice theory topology and random functions mm is most commonly applied to digital images but it can be employed as well on graphs surface meshes solids and many other spatial structures topological and geometrical concepts such as size shape convexity connectivity and geodesic distance were introduced by mm on both continuous and discrete spaces mm is also the foundation of morphological image processing which consists of a set of operators that transform images according to the above characterizations the basic morphological operators are erosion dilation opening and closing mm was originally developed for binary images and was later extended to grayscale functions and images the subsequent generalization to complete lattices is widely accepted today as mms theoretical foundation
johan de witt or jan de witt heer van en snelrewaard hekendorp and ijsselveere september august was a key figure in dutch politics in the century when its flourishing sea trade in a period of globalisation made the united provinces a leading european power during the dutch golden age de witt controlled the netherlands political system from around until shortly before his death in working with various factions from nearly all the major cities especially his hometown dordrecht and the city of birth of his wife amsterdam as a republican he opposed the house of orange he was also strongly liberal preferring lesser power to the central government and more power to the regenten however his negligence of the dutch land army as the regents focused only on merchant vessels thinking they could avoid war proved disastrous when the dutch republic suffered numerous early defeats in the rampjaar in the hysteria that followed the effortless invasion by an alliance of three countries he and his brother cornelis de witt were blamed and lynched in the hague
victor ivanovich shestakov was a logician and theoretician of electrical engineering in he discovered the possible interpretation of boolean algebra of logic in relay circuits he graduated from moscow state university and worked there in the general physics department almost until his death shestakov proposed a theory of electric switches based on boolean logic earlier than claude shannon according to certification of soviet logicians and mathematicians sofya yanovskaya mg roland dobrushin oleg lupanov yu a gastev yu t medvedev and vladimir andreevich uspensky though shestakov and shannon defended theses the same year and the first publication of shestakovs result took place only in in russian in the early century relay circuits began to be more widely used in automatics defense of electric and communications systems every relay circuit schema for practical use was a distinct invention because the general principle of simulation of these systems was not known shestakovs credit and independently later claude shannons is the general theory of logical simulation inspired by the rapidly increasing complexity of technical demands logical simulation requires solid mathematical foundations namely these foundations were originally established by shestakov shestakov set forth an algebraic logic model of electrical switches later and switches with series and parallel connections of schematic elements resistors capacitors magnets inductive coils etc resistance of these elements could take arbitrary values on the line and upon the set this degenerates into the bivalent boolean algebra of logic shestakov may be considered as a forerunner of combinatorial logic and its application and hence boolean algebra of logic as well in electric engineering the language of which is broad enough to simulate objects of any conceivable physical nature he was a pioneer of study of merged continual algebraic logic parametrical and topological structural models
