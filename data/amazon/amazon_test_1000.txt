this model has a screen and is viewable even in direct sunlight the only problem i experienced was the stammeringstuttering and excessive repetitions of directions this is a software problem not a seller or shipper problemi contacted tomtom i was instructed to go online and uninstall certain amounts of software and reinstall it from the website i did just that a couple pf trips later the stammering came back repeated itself about times then gave me the wrong directions to my destination the gps recalculated then told me to make a right turn into a subdivision which was in the opposite direction of the destination point i drive for a living and knows the raods that i am on i also carries paper maps with me too i really dont trust these tomtoms the first one i threw it out of the window of my car a tomtom xl i am computer literate and a software troubleshooter all software was updated on both of these online weekly not monthlyanyway i am waiting for tomtom to get back to me about the second stammeringstuttering problem
simple usb extention cables they are high quality and work without a flaw the only caution i would give a potential buyer is tha the head on the female end is a little larger than a normal extention cable it makes it easy to grasp and use but if you need to fit it into a tight place you may need to run it from the small end dont get me wrong its not huge but some of the places we run cables can be tight anyway so just note that otherwise i am extremely happy with these cables i bought sets if you need usb extentionsbuy these dont waste your money on more expensive cables that do exactly the same thingcarry electical signals to and from your pcdevice
have used one for several years with the head and find it very handy it is well built and sturdy with caveat the locking clamps seem to be prone to cracking as i have replaced of them this seems to happen after being stored for an extended period with the clamps locked i now store it with the clamps unlocked i dont know if the newer model is any better in this respect the clamp assemblies are user replaceable if you have a little mechanical skill and are available by calling manfrotto and asking for the parts department top large r middle medium r bottom small r if the clamps were a little more break resistant id have rated this a
i have owned a lot of different headphones for my iphones i use mine for commute on train for music and audio bookspodcasts in the car for calls and at the gym for musicother audio contentthese are the most expensive headphonesearbuds with a mic ive owned but i have used the sony fontopias as well as a sennheiser in ear plug as well as bud skull candy buds and plugs as well as some in apple and sony knockoffs you can get for per pair here or on ebaythese are the best sounding headphones buds or plugs i have heard on my iphone and easily the best earphonesplugs with a mic the price is not inconsiderable but worth it if you want nuanced sounds clear highs and powerful but not ridiculous bass these are rather audiophile quality without a doubt very very impressive sound very efficient quite acceptably loud for most content at half or slightly better than half volume settingthe highs are clear which is usually the knock on ear plug style phones better than the sony fontopias which are boomy bass and unclear highs midrange is balanced lows are powerful full but not boomy or overpowering just a warm rich sound very nicethe build quality is superior to any similar product two weeks into it and they are sturdy and just work very very cool looking i feel like a guy listening to ear plugs very excellent ambient noise reduction and reasonably comfy fitif the cable is allowed to flop on your chest when you run or work out you do get the cable thump sound secure the cable or loop the phones around the back of your head i have not found this to be an impediment to my using them to spend or min on the treadmill or doing resistance training with machines and weightsfabulous purchase i will likely never switch to a different brand or consider an because even at twice the price these are in the plugstyle buds with a mic to beat and nothing ive used comes close
i pulled it out of the box plugged it in and installed the software in less than minutes flat i have no issues with compatibility with vistawhich is surprising to me because ive had them before thanks microsoft for being compatible and easy to install my husband and i had a blast playing with all of the screen shot features that allow you to add funny objects into the screen alongside the picture the objects somehow will attach themselves to your face to make you appear to be a monster or a pink haired rockstar girl or appear to have a small nose etc these features caused us to spend about an hour or more trying things and giggling hystericallythe camera does not interupt ones ability to do other functions on the computer at the same time i give it two thumbs up for ease of use it simply does what you need a camera to do i experienced no freezing no issues whatsoever love it
the sound clarity of these headphone is great and the price is very reasonable they are very clear and you do not get the crackling you sometimes get in headphones when you turn the volume up this might be do to the volume limit on the headphones i like the fact that you can adjust the volume on the headseat instead of always having to go to your computer however they could have a better design for the control of the volume another annoying thing is the two lines they do not divide far enough apart i dont have a microphone input on the front of my pc and i want to plug the headphones in the front of my speakers or pc instead i am forced to unplug my speakers to hook these up if i want to use the microphone and headseat for chat
i have three excellent manfrotto tripods and two medium expensive panheads which i love but this one was too cheesy when you tighten the lock screw for the vertical offset the camera tilts a few degrees to the side this is unacceptable also the handle is on the side opposite of the lock screw and the way the forces play out the camera tilts when you move the handle up and down when the screw isnt tight enough and while it has an rc plate the plate is held in place with a single screw from the side i dont like the design of this head one bit but unfortunately manfrotto stopped making the heads i used to buy looks like ill have to spend a lot more money henceforth
i own a netgear prosafe port gigabit switch after running out of ports on this switch that had worked without issue i looked to replace it with another ive read the horror stories of netgears prosafe switch and decided to avoid it instead i chose the cisco sdt its setup is a no brainer similar to all unmanaged switches what has definitely stood out for me is its speed it is much more responsive the the netgear switch it replaced my netgear switch seems to be much higher in delays than this cisco the cisco is very quick in delivering network contentthe only minor note when compared to the netgear is that the netgear does indicate network speed for all individual ports the cisco only shows a port as being active or not but not its speed this is so minor that i am not deducting anything due to it though
its water tight so of course air tight its tough as hell theres an option to get a name plate to affix care is easy longevity is apparently many many moonsi like the look anyway so both my subjective aesthetics and anyones objective appreciation of practicality concur as qualities to embrace especially at this sweet sale pricegotta love this linei will without doubt get a second one and likely in black green is not too loud or weird a subdued low hueed good green one mild iota more forest than my all time fave od olive drabvery good deal and i am a completely satisfied transactionerone happy customer says mahalo nui loathanks amazon thanks vendor and thanks pelican
bought this for portability while it success in that realm it lacks in the space the legs are very cumbersome and clumsy to deal with and absolutely do not feel sturdy the twist lock design is the major downfall of this tripods legging system the ball head was soso it desperately needs a quick release i know one can be added but it would be nice to have it there from the getgoneedless to say i returned it and am still searching for a portable tripod that can safely support my eos d and ef mm f l usm lens combo a quite heavy lens i might add
fter doing a lot of research and seeing the problems that many have using other branded webcams with windows and skype i thought it would be wise to go with a microsoft webcam this little webcam simply plugged in to a spare usb port hooks nicely and securely on top of any flatscreen monitor no drivers were necessary as windows installed them on its own the webcam worked straight away and in widescreen on skype with a wonderful quality picture very happy with this purchase would recomend to anyone that is looking for quality webcam that works on win win many thanks amazon
i was installing some new speakers in my home theater and bought this because of my firm belief that the overpriced wire sold at big box stores is not worth it i decided that i would buy this wire because it was priced right and copper i am not a speaker or wire expert but this seems like good speaker wire to me one of my rear speakers was already wired with different cheaper looking wire and i couldnt rewire it so i can compare this wire to the cheaper looking wire i really cant tell the difference in sound between the two speakers but feel more comfortable that i bought this in case there is a small difference that i just cant appreciate i would buy this again
in my quest for the best stylus to draw and paint with on the ipad i finally purchased the wacom bamboo stylus i have been a wacom user for many years i started with a graphire tablet and eventually graduated to the intuos line my gripe with the ipad has always been that one could not get anywhere near the drawing experience on it as i could with my intuos does the bamboo stylus make the ipad like a cintiq display tablet hardly but its a step up from any rubber tipped stylus i have tried to date it is well bablanced and there are replacement nibs available reviewers who complain that the nips wear out should note that no capacitive stylus lasts foreverand the more you use it the less it glides on the tablet glass surfaceso wacom has done the customer a favor by making replacement nibs available as otherwise in a few months one would end up having to replace the entire expensive stylus completely i reccomend it highly although i cant comment on how it compares with one of the plastic hard disk drawing implements for sketching and writing you really cant beat this but if you enjoy painting a more natural media like painting experince is available with something like the nomad brushhowever ive found that that type of stylus not so good for sketching as one cant put enough pressure on the brush bristles to create crisp linesit is a good approximation of a round brush but not a flat onethe bamboo would give you more of a flat brush painting experience i cant reccomend the bamboo paper application though as it is extremely limited both in terms of tools and color palate and i hope that wacom rethinks thatbut you can try it for free from the app store and see for yourself weather its your cup of teaif youre just taking notes you might like it if you want to write as well as draw a better virtual sketchbook is the paper app by with the bamboo stylus that app really rocks again you can try a starter edition if you desire to try before you buy
this optical cable served as an upgrade for my original optical digital audio cable ft foremost i upgraded to the ft cable to connect my yamaha rxv receiver to my computer while also allowing the cable to drop to the floor as compared to the tautstretched ft cable i was previously using there was no diminished audio quality with the longer cableadditional benefits include a very solid connection to my audio receiver and my computers motherboard secure connectors providing security at both ends of the cable and the almost nonexistent possibility of kinks in the cable andor damage to the cable due to the pvc layer and mesh metal jacketthough i readily admit the price was higher than most optical cables of equal length youre not only paying for the quality of the cable matters cables but also for the amazing aestheticsdesign it not only serves as a high quality optical cable but looks the part as well just one more upgrade to make your friends jealous
i had watched this webcam to see if it ever went below and it finally did so i bought a twopack for a really good price i was disappointed to say the least the camera is grainy and while it does have good color reproduction the graininess and lack of speed over the usb bus was alarming all the reviews touted the glass lens as if that matters when its the sensors in this camera that is the main disappointment pictures are oversaturated and lowlight exposure is overly grainy the thing is these two combine for a lowquality picture that doesnt compress well over an internet connection due to all the grain and blurrinesseven though this aging expensive camera is now available a more reasonable price i still recommend trying the new storebrand generic uvc cameras instead of this one this camera is outdated and not really a good value the generic uvc camera is definitely a much better value and delivers a better picture than this onethe lifecam software has great effects that are a lot of fun i hope the newer generation of microsoft cameras are better when it comes to picture quality and frame rate without blurrying
im not a professional and got this calibrator for my w laptop and external monitors to calibrate color accuracy on displays i read few other reviews here before i decided to buy this set first i want to explain why i removed one star the sw on the included cd is from and several versions behind so i downloaded windows version and use this for my review this is an unnecessary complication for a pro productthe installation works without problems so i started my st monitor calibration there are several ways you can do this basic and advanced mode and the provided help and hints will guide you through the options explaining the advantages and disadvantagesat the end of a quite fast calibration without problems an icc profile is created and copied to the windows folder so the product does a great job with the latest swnow the next step while working with a calibrated displays is to get all sw working adobe products support color profiles but most browsers not accept firefox also windows picture viewer doesnt work correct but quicktime picture viewer doesso be prepared for some extra work using the right applications for your workflow
i have to add to other reviewer comments that this speaker product does not keep and maintain the internet connection i have attempted to reconnect and have finally given up and am asking to return it to the seller due to it being defective i only gave it two stars as it does produce good sound quality for the price i will probably order a similar product that might prove to be a better performer with a stronger link to my internet connection i suggest anyone who wants to purchase this product to be aware of the problems i have experienced
i use this for my laptop it really helps me keep it cool while gaming it lowers the temp at least cc for it to be more efficient i must place the laptop a little forward so that the laptops main vents get direct cooling from this padthe pad is nice and sleek very light weight i have it stationary on my desk however i would see no problem carrying it in my laptop bag where the documents compartment isbefore buying this cooling pad i looked up a lot of different models and brands and this one seemed to be the best to fit my needs and it did very nice sleek looking
ive been building computers as a hobby for the last years and must say i was amazed how much faster my i was over my amd thowever im really amazed by the overall performance boost when i purchased the i core if you include the logical cores processor even in nonmultithreaded applications there seems to be an overall boost to system performance and also stabilityi do a lot of compressing and encryption watching a gb file become encrypted and compressed in winzip in mere seconds is pretty impressiveit does come with a fairly good heatsink and im not rushing to buy another one im not a hardcore overclocked and so far this processor has all the speed i need using arctic silver and the stock heatsink the temperature never goes above when using something that maxes the cpu out for an extended period ie handbrake with speedstep turned on in mode it idles in the upper sc what other people and benchmarks say even gaming ie crysis seems to have a noticeable improvement in both game stability and startup time using arctic silver and the stock heatsink the temperature never goes above when using something that maxes the cpu out for an extended period ie handbrakenow on the other hand is it worth well it all depends on how much you use your computer plus i sold my i on a major auction site for and my corsair a for so for me the extra is worth it the performance is that impressive however it is still in the category for meif youre an engineer or graphic artist and need the performance for your work i would say its well worth it if you have a multithreaded app
i purchased the switcheasy canvas on the recommendation of my son who has owned one for over a year i originally purchased the toblino and it was fine but i did notice that the switcheasy seemed to be more durable and had better aesthetics after living with it for a month i would give it a b it is indeed durable and easy to use but there are a few complaints it has a tendency to slide when folded upright not a huge issue but an issue nonetheless it is also a bit clumsy when holding with two hands with no other support again not a big issue but something that may influence some buyers on the plus side it is extremely attractive and protects the ipad very well i can easily recommend this casecover as it is probably one of the better ones out there andi paid about on amazon where my son paid over originally direct from switcheasy a great deal for a case of this quality
i needed an external fingerprint reader when my thinkpad ts lid is closed on the docking station i opened package plugged it into the back of the docking station and powered on my already configured laptop the new device was immediately recognized and worked perfectly i do think the ts built in fingerprint reader is slightly more accurate but then to be fair i did register my fingerprints using the built in fingerprint reader i can only recommend the hardware my thinkpad t already has an integrated fingerprint security solution so i have not looked at the included software so i have no idea about its quality or functionality
this was a great battery for the first six months after i purchased it like many others i was hesitant to buy a nonapple branded battery because of the obvious price difference i thought by buying the more expensive aftermarket i might and find a perfect replacement not sothe battery now only holds about minutes of charge it has begun to bulge out and my laptop now wobbles when im working on a flat surface its turned a sleek piece of engineering design into something dreadful and im not exaggerating on the bulge its about a quarter inch so much that i can actually see inside the battery i think i could live with the bulge or the diminishing performance after six months but not both i would have rather paid half the price for another aftermarket that only lasts six months
i cant get over the fantastic sharpness near perfect exposure this camera provides in auto setting a true point and shoot and i am just beginning to understand all well most of the functions dont let all the whistles and bells scare you if you are just wanting to take pictures of friends and family you will look like an expert you may become addicted and really get into what all this camera can do even at long distances it is incredible i have shots of a nesting bald eagle from feet where you can count feather and pick out the smallest detail the camera will take a huge gb card but an gb is plenty just be sure it is a fast one like a sandick extreme hd video i also purchased the two pack battery and charger kit which was an excellent choice as it is small and works well the case none comes with the camera booo which is listed in the buy together really doesnt fit the camera well while it is well made it is a tight and awkward fit and made worse by the neck strap you may look at my review im looking for a replacement
i read through some other reviews and some people have some good points especially in regard to placement with the cigarette lighter so you should consider their opinions as well as mine and make the best judgment if this is a good choice for youi drive a ford focus the cigarette lighter is placed just to the right of the steering wheel and this fit there just fine it tends to pull the metal of the lighter out with it when i pull it out some care is needed in this regard however this is more the fault of the lighter than this device i believe i am using this with a gb iphone g the iphone is in a case i did not have to take the case apart to work with this device unlike many docking stations i also used this with my girlfriends older gb second generation iphone both worked identically with this devicei am writing this review after using this for a round trip drive from san francisco to las vegas and back one of the hardest things about transmitters is finding a good dead air channel to broadcast over i have previously used an older transmitter with other mp players and had no success at all within san francisco because there is very little dead air here to find this device has less interference and is less picky about complete dead air than the older transmitter i had used it wasnt easy but i was able to locate several good dead zones and was able to start using this before i left my san francisco driveway on the way to vegas its a mile drive or so i only had to change the station once twice coming back i had to change it not too bad for such a long drive there were very few times i had any noticeable interference which was not the case with my older transmitterthe cradle was initially pretty loose when i first used it after tightening up the screws the device clicks tilt positions so you can adjust the angle the way you want itone drawback is the iphone pretty much covers the channel changing buttons on the transmitter you can still press the buttons but i found it difficult to see the readout when trying to do this this is especially challenging if youre trying to change stations while driving thats about my only real complaint with this it seems to charge the phone as fast as a wall charger and i was overall pleased with the quality of audio i got with it its a huge improvement over the transmitter i bought several years ago for a lot more money
did extensive online research on small portable computers primarily for business travel the netbooks too small for my needs the notebooks too big the acer is perfect size for my use acer makes several models in this size i chose the most expensive due to it having the best specs only about difference from the least expensive however never tested it in a store so cant comment on performance differences in the range to date i have been very pleased i dont particularly like touch pads so added a wireless notebook mouse comes in several colors mine is black the top is a shiny piano black that shows all finger prints but easily cleaned not a complaint just an observation netbooks dont have an optical drive i purchased an acer assessory kit online that had the drive the mouse and a case for acer price is closer to i have worked in computer companies for years and am on computers all day i am not technical however i have had enough computers to know which features and functions are desireable for me i like this one so much i keep it on my kitchen counter to check mail etc speed on wifi seems excellent netflix streaming movies fine sound is above average for net and notebooks picture quality good battery life good depending on how you use it like all battery pcs for travel would be using headphones anyways in total highly recommend with no reservations as a second computer
i have not had problem what ever with this cable it appears to be well insulated and well made with the long length you can keep it connected to the tv all the time and rout it in such a way that it can reach your seat to watch internet content from your computer just reach under your seat to get the end of the cable and plug it into your pc you dont even need to get out of your chair or bedto get even more functionality you can get as i did a combo micromini hdmi connector so you can watch content from your phone or camcorder conveniently from your chair or bed using this long hdmi cable my camcorder has a mini hdmi port and my phone has a micro hdmi port
this enclosure works for me if you have a lot of hard drives floating around or if you need to recover something from a hard drive that you took out from another pc it works great i was happy with it until today i heard something rattling inside the plastic enclosure and i opened it up to see what it is at the bottom of the case they installed a metal plate to give it stability the metal plate is held down by tiny screws that tie into the plastic bottom due to the fact that the plastic is brittle the screw connections are broken and now the plate rattles inside the case i took mine out because it was hitting on the capacitors the unit seems stable enough without the weight because the base has a decent size if you hear something rattling in the box either open it up to see what it is or send it back for warranty do not continue to use it like thatfor the poor design and low quality materials stars for the way it works starsi never dropped my enclosure it did work flawlessly to date for probably a year now
what can i say i was a bit horrified at the price especially as we already had the sonos app on out itouch so could access and control the system for freehowever i think every home should have at least one of these rcs they reek of quality looks fabulous and would look great on the sideboard in the lounge waiting to be used the interface is brilliant fast and having all album covers and track lists available is greatalso the interface to lastfm and the other radio programs has meant i am not listening to a lot more tailored radio from the uk i can now get radio from the uk in crystal clear clarity which is wonderfulcant say enough good things about this some things are just worth paying for
i was so excited to get this it is compact and simple to set up unfortunately it didnt work on either of my devices xbox or lg lrm dvr i could clearly see that the unit was recieving a signal from my remote thanks to the nifty indicator light on the repeater box however the remote commands were just not getting through to my devices i tried repositioning the ir emmitters numerous times and tried plugging them into ever different plug on the repeater to no avail i know that its not an issue with my dvr because my slingbox has ir emmitters on it and it can control the dvr just fine oh well its going back to amazon
ike the previous reviewer i purchased this from the google play store for my wife i got tired of her using my new ipad so i figured this would be an inexpensive solution to the problem quite honestly i wasnt expecting much considering the ridiculously low price im very impressed with the technology and simplicity that went into its design this googlesamsung chromebook is really quite amazing the first thing that youll notice is that its extremely lightweight and is very uncomplicated this is something that my year old motherinlaw would be able to use right out of the box since shes never used a computer before that says a lot many of the everyday apps that you use on a daily basis are preloaded into the device it comes with things like youtube gmail and other google products and there are literally thousands of free apps available it starts up very quickly and according to google updates are installed automatically ive found all applications to run smoothly and quickly the fact that it comes with a regular keyboard is a tremendous plus and the touchpad works flawlessly while the screen isnt the most impressive that ive ever seen it is certainly more than adequate i will continue to use my ipad but now that i also have this my wife will have her own travel size computer to use all in all this device offers far more than i expected i didnt give it a great deal of thought when i purchased it as its not going to be used by me now after running it through the paces im really in awe that something as inexpensive as this could do so many things while the ipad and this device are different animals this chromebook is more than capable of performing many of the things that my ipad is capable of doing i dont think theres any way you can possibly go wrong purchasing this sleek looking device ive purchased many products from samsung in the past and have always been impressed with their quality and durability since this is a new computer its impossible to say if any problems will arise but based on past experience i have no doubt that this will be real workhorse and will last for years at the price that its being sold for its almost disposable when something newer comes along the bottom line is that youll be very impressed with this product and youll be in awe how they could have built so much into such an inexpensive computer i give it stars my wife gives it stars too now that i finally let her use it
ive been a big fan of olympus from day one ive been using digital cameras for a few years but have never owned one until now so i wanted to make sure i got the most bang for my buck i was looking at this camera and the canon s which has just hit the shelves i opted for this camera over the canon despite its few shortcomings let me explainto start off with ill give you the downside you cant record audio in movie mode so just get a video camera if you want to record videos low lighting shooting can be difficult since there is no infrared sensor top assist with the shots disappointing finally there is no manual focus which could actually assist with the low light shooting but alas it was not included this is why i give it starson the positive side pictures are fantastic i take this camera with me everywhere and barely have to make any adjustments for my picture taking also the camera allows you to rotate the pictures and crop within the camera itself so for those of you that take lots of portrait shots like me have that capability before downloading to your computer such a time saverthe xdpicture card that it utilizes is the size of a postage stamp the card has a current capacity of mb with the mb card due by the end of this month in another year or so the capacity will theoretically reach almost gb thats an insane amount of pictures but its what you need on those vacationsplus the battery life is excellent ive used this thing like a workhorse and have taken pictures to fill up my mb card downloaded the pictures and started taking more and still didnt have to recharge the battery im getting a backup just so i dont ever have to take my charger with mebottom line is this megapixel camera has all of the bells and whistles you come to expect from olympus and then some for a camera this small that i can pop in my pocket and forget about it i think the money spent is well worth it even with the shortcomings i mentioned above i highly recommend it
im using this otg cable to connect a microsoft mouse with a transreceiver to my nexus in landscape mode and it does the job the connection is quite firm even though the cable does not go completely in the usb port of the nexus moreover there is enough room for me to put in my headphones and listen to music while the cable is connected i never did this before and honestly didnt even even know till i read some of the reviews on amazon that a mouse and keyboard could be connected in this manner i had to do a search on the internet to figure out how to do this at first it didnt work and i thought i had a defective product but when i pushed the transreceiver harder into the other end i got the cursor on my nexus and it has worked ever since i like using the mouse much more than my fingers on the nexus the bottom line is that this otg micro cable is a winnerit took days for it to come via usps from baton rouge la to nyc
i received this via the amazon vine program as a courtesy product to review i was curious and eager to see how it would work but after looking at the instructions i could see that this would not be an easy installation you either have to hot wire it or have it replace the inside button i was having a lot of trouble understanding where to start after reading some reviews of my fellow vine members i decided that it was not worth the time and the effort i already have an outside keypad that works fine and was only a fraction of what this retails sorry but this wasnt a good product for me

this product is appropriate for extending the life of older computers i purchased it to get an hdmi output for my more recent hp core i machine and assumed that the card would also improve graphics performance it didnt both windows experience index numbers are worse on the card than on the motherboards intel hd graphics chip desktop score went from to the same as reported in other reviews and d gaming score went from to these are all quite acceptable numbers its just a disappointment that the card doesnt do as well as either the integrated graphics or the ancient and expensive geforce gt on my gaming machine desktop gamingthe card works well driving a dualmonitor setup with my tv there is noticeable mouse lag on the tv side but im sure thats the tvs fault not the cards media center still grabs the mouse in fullscreen mode and wont let you move it to the desktop monitor thats been a known bug since vista that ms has never fixed the gpu tweek utility supplied with the card seems a little gimmicky im sure gamers want to try to squeeze every last cycle out of the card before it fails but adjusting clock speeds from the default to maximum gaming profiles didnt make any difference in the windows scores i didnt measure the minimum power save profile because the card already does auto power savethis is a fine inexpensive hdmi video port buy it for that purpose or to upgrade a lowerend machine and you wont be disappointed
i ordered this mouse because i have other logitech devices and they seem to be pretty decent i also saw the feedback commenting on how this mouse didnt work with someones system and experienced delay in responding well my system apparently doesnt like the mouse as well after installation movement of the cursor on screen was erratic sometimes it would follow the mouse movements and then at times it would wait a few seconds and then start moving i tried it on a few different surfaces to see if that made a difference but it was still erratic my corded mouse works great though i guess ill stick with corded mice after this experience so i dont know what is causing such different ratings and performance of the mouse but just be aware it may not work well on your system or it may be just fine incidentally my system is new with an intel i processor windows os
when i ordered this i was expecting the size to rival that of my nano mouse receiver this drive sticks out a little further than my nano receiver so i was initially a bit worried about keeping it inserted during transport however it seems to hold up fine in the briefcase while still attached to the computer transfer speed is on par with my other usb flash drives there was nothing remarkable either positive or negative with my transfers the backup software is not bad i tried it for a while to keep track of photos text files wordexcel docs pdf files and other things i routinely dump to the desktop ive never been a big fan of automated backup im probably the only mac owner in america with six gb usb drives who doesnt use time machine so i eventually uninstalled the software and now just use the drive as an ordinary gb flash drive then again i regularly manually backup my files to several disk drives for redundancy if you dont have the timeresources to do all that this is actually a pretty good backup solution especially if you have a ton of files or if youre always on the move studentsworkers with netbooks and laptops are perfect examples and want the reassurance of automated backup this drive shines at managing new music video and photo files but at gb if you have a collection large enough to justify automated backup youre likely going to need more room very soon forget about whole disk backups unless you have an older smaller os like win xp win vista win and mac osx would all be too large requiring gb win and gb mac respectively for the os alone lexar offers a trial gb online backup solution but at the size of this drive its not a viable option either unless you plan to upgrade
i have a couple of headphones and am familiar with the sennheiser product line as i own another one of their headphones as well as several shotgun microphoneswhen evaluating headphones i find it is helpful to monitor the sound as its coming in from a recorder that is hooked up to the headphones and have the input signal on one ear channel while one listens to the actual sound there will be a slight time lag but its hardly noticeablebased on that admittedly nonscientific evaluation i find the fidelity of the headphones to be very goodthe other important factor is the physical comfort of wearing the headphones in this regard i can say that i can wear the phones for several hours without too much fatiguefourandahalf stars for the sennheiser hd
the panasonic line and i needed a everyday camera to have in my purse and my bulky more profesional cameras wont do because of space and care they need so this camera was on sale and i decided to give it a try the truth is i did not like it very muchits body seems like it will fall apart any time and when you turn it on it makes this awful noise its scary it really feels and sounds like a toy camera performance ok but buttons on top the onoff and the shootwithout more quick shooting options i think this camera would be present for your year old niece as a first real camera not what i expected not returning it though because the truth is it was really really cheap so im giving itto my year old niece
it works a little sticky easy to clean off with isopropyl acolohol if you need to try to get it perfect a few timesthere are a lot of reviews online comparing the performance of various thermal pastes so check out this product therei am sure it works a lot better than the stock paste that came with the crappy heatsink on my sandy bridge k i used this with an arctic freezer pro version from newegg and i havent pushed the processor yet to the point where the combination cant handle itthe auto overclock feature on my msi board took the k to and the temps stayed under even under load not bad i supposethere is enough paste here to try to get the coverage right as many times as you like believe me i played with it quite a lot
i have the soundworks without the i pod dock i purchased it about years ago at that time they had a day no obligation to purcahse period you could try the unit for days and if you were not satisfied you could return it i had a bose wave radio and i must admit when i heard the cambridge i was blown away for dollars i could get bass that surpassed that produced by the bose and in addition i could adjust the bass and treble which you can not do on the bose it was a no brainer i kept the radio and have been completely satisfied with my purchasea couple of weeks ago the subwoofer stopped working the sound that comes out of the two small speakers is really shrill and apalling the subwoofer is what made it sound so good i have looked at the soundworks radio and the difference in quality is readily apparent just from looking at it the power cord now has a brick attached to it which the original did not in addition to that there is a port missing on the back which the old radio had that allowed and it is obvious that quality has gone down not to mention the of an ipod dock which many may not need or wanti have read the reviews for their latest iteration of the and due to the number of complaints given for this unit i have decided not to purchase another radio for fear that it is of quality similarly after yars of satisfaction with my bose i will not buy another due to the fact that the new bose models do not have any buttons im truly thankful for the reviews here for i was just about to fork over bucks for a new cambridge now that i know what i already suspected i definitely will not buy one im just gon na have my old one fixed by a local shop
got this camera on a whim as a replacement for my canon model which i dropped into a lake it is a decent camera and i havent had any serious problems with it however i have noticed that this thing drains battery life like a vampire even with high end batteries i cant take many pictures before they dieand i never leave batteries in the camera when it is not in use i know it sounds crazy but i swear before i started taking the batteries out after use i would put a new set in take a few pictures and when i came back to the camera a few days later the batteries would be dead also there are sometimes two phantom spots in my pictures one on the left side of the lens and one in the upper right corner i have tried rubbing the lens with a cloth but the spots always show up in my picturesall in all i am okay with this camera but i would not buy it again
this is an original product as far as i can tell but being and oem item and priced as such i understand if my storage drive goes out i probably cant use on new drive i opted to pay the lower price as i am expecting my storage drive will have no problems for a lot longer than i will be using windows i am actually using this os with boot camp on a macbook air with an allflash drive storage and as i said it works very fast and perfectly i opted for this over windows based on reviews that i have read and also read that hp is going back to windows over windows on some of their new models they will be coming out with that does not say much for windows
this is my third experience with a wireless range extender and ive come to finally believe what all of the articles on cnet and pcmag have said all along most range extenders are ok at best the issues are twofold generally speaking the process of extending your signal is actually a repeating process so if you have a fairly highdemand home environment i have a roku player or tablets going plus a laptop the speed and smoothness of the signal will suffer dramatically and secondly this extender unlike the trendnet which i also tried and returned creates a separate ssid on your network so on all of your wireless devices you need to pick which network youre going to connect to your routers or this one and this can be a really headache on any devices you may roam around the house withim sure theres a fit somewhere out there for this but it definitely wasnt my house im now just investing in a whole new higherend router and ill set that up strictly as a wap fingers crossed
having owned and returned the original due to the muddy sound i am a bit more impressed with the ii sound overall mids highs and lows are improved i can actually stand to listen to this one but for it is still lacking i still do not understand why they did not include aux output a simple feature that would have added to the value of this item to be able to route sound through your stereo would be an excellent feature i plan on keeping this one and will probably look into adding an aux output that automatically disables the device speakers when you plug in
i know the yongnuo ex ttl god a bad reputation in the past and likely the reason why its reviews are slightly lower is because the original design had some issues that were causing the unit to fail apparently this newer model was redesigned to make it more reliable and ive had no issues using it thus far ive had it for two weeks and have taken several hundred shots with it and its working great thus far ive been so pleasently surprised with how much better my pictures have been turning out i am finally able to shoot indoors and have beautiful pictures using this flash to bounce light onto my subjects and even my outdoor shots are much improved being able to use this as a fill flash to lighten up my subjects i purchased a set of eneloop batteries with it and ive been able to shoot in continuous mode on my ti with no issues with the flash lagging behind for the price and considering how much more youd have to spend on a canon flash i would highly recommend the
i purchased this item for my new ipod touch th generation thinking it would protect it from scratches and damage while the backside went on smoothly the front was full of bubbles that didnt go away even after days neither side would protect the itouch at all if it were ever dropped because they both are just thin pieces of film that must be applied wet and are very difficult to get positioned properly the bubbles on the front side never did go away like the tech rep at zagg said they would so i returned this poor quality product for a refund
bought this to copy data from my wifes laptop hdd when the motherboard frieddrive installs pretty easily but connection to sata connector seems loose until its installed into the case the foam padding on the inside of the opposite end of the case keeps the drive steady and in place i wouldnt bounce it around but then again i wouldnt do that with any of my electronicsit is made of aluminum which seems to help keep the drive cool and seems solid enough to protect the drive should it fall or something should fall on itthe one draw back is the tiny screws used to hold the adapter in the case they are the smallest screws ive ever seen after pulling the case off my laptop just to see the inside i can attest that there arent any screws inside my laptop that small because of the small size getting them lined up so they dont cross thread can be very tricky they can also be easy to lose if dropped and i wouldnt want to even guess how hard they could be to replace my advice dont switch out the drive too much and you should be fine thoughall in all pretty solid and you cant seem to beat the price
i was very lucky to pic this up from amazon for delivered while i was aware of the cloud effect that some have complained about i tested immediately upon delivery and this unit was fine out of the box set up is simple the inputs are easy to access i have not tried the setup for the color yet but the delivered basic has a slight red shift but nothing terrible what really stud out for me hen i evaluated this tv along side others is the crispness of the blacks and the detail in low light scenes of course the colors are remarkable all in all one month after purchase i am extremely happy that i made this purchasei have linked this to my computer with an dvi and hdmi output and the p is remarkable i dont have an hddvd or blueray to try that out yet
this is a very good case with a good custom fit for the asus me tablet it has a high quality feel to it and the magnetic clasp gives a reassuring when you close the lid the folding cover allows the device to be propped up for landscape video viewing and the port cutouts are very functional it feels very substantialthe only issues ive found are probably more related to the me itself the placement of the controls on the left side of the device instead of the right side like on the nexus means that those buttons are harder to get to because that is where the case cover joins the case body i find myself having to bend the cover back and then actually look at the device to press the button there are separate cutouts there for the power and volume rocker and really a single larger cutout would have made this easier to useoverall this is a must have case if you have the me tablet
i wanted to like this mouse its very pretty and its all kinds of geeky cool its bluetooth so you dont have to use a usb port slender enough to fit in most laptop bags without an unsightly bulge and applebranded so it matches my macbook prounfortunately thats where the love affair ended once i sat down and actually started using it for any significant amount of time i realized the problems that ultimately led me to return itim a software developer so i spend a lot of time on keyboards and mice my hands are pretty sensitive to carpal tunnel symptoms i have an ergonomic keyboard at work and a special mouse that relieves pressure on my wrists the magic mouse is so thin that you basically have to hold it between your thumb and pinky finger the gestures you use have your pointer and middle finger up and bent most of the time which is very uncomfortable hold your hand out like a claw and see how long you you can go before it starts to crampperhaps this is a personal preference if you hold the mouse differently you might not have the issues i did however please take the time before you buy this mouse to go to a store and use one for a good long while see if your hand hurts afterward if it does save your seventy bucks and just buy a comfortable nano receiver mouse instead
wow is all i can say about this product i must say i was very skeptical about it when i saw it online i just received the item today and did a quick channel search and i was able to pick up all the available stations crystal clear i live about miles from most of the main tv towers and all the stations come in at signal strength and higher i have used a cheap set of rca and a trek hdtva this products quality is about the same as the trek hdtva minus the bulkiness if your thinking about getting an indoor antenna stop researching and just get this item you will not be disappointed
im an electrical engineer and ordered of these for our lab so i could backup our test data videos pictures on gb drives we have laying around worked great out of the box the base is heavy enough as to not fall down with drive installed and wont move on the desk using the usb cable getting about mbs great instructions inside the box about how to partition your harddrive using the windows tool took less than minute from installing the drive into the base to being partitionedquick fomratted and ready for data transfer have not tried the esata connection great buy for home or work
this yamaha is a pretty decent receiver works well with most stereotype speakers it has lots of inputs for speakers digital component and composite the front panel is simple to use with a big volume tuner and orangeamber color display yamaha has imbedded some decoders so that you can set how you like your receiver to sound like game movie music etcsome drawbacks i found was the remote controller its a bit clumsy and comes in black which doesnt quite match the silver receiver the buttons on the remote are also a bit tiny this unit only has channels so it will work well if you just want a set up if youre looking for or then youd have to look for another unit another drawback i found was that if you just hook up stereo speakers the bass seems quite weak even if you boosted the all the way up on the bass you would definetely need a powered subwoofer to maximize this receiverother than that it is a pretty good system for the price worth a look
price wise you can not beat these i have bought headphones in this price range and they have only lasted a few listens if these headphones do not last long i still feel they are worth it with the faux leather case it comes with the faux leather case has a key chain attached to it with a zipper inside you have two mesh pockets one side has extra ear bud fittings they come in size s m and l i have been using the ones that were sent on the headphones and they fit my ears great the seal is not perfect but i think if i were to buy a different type of fitting they might seal better in my ears sound wise i am impressed not superb but very good i have been using them with my ipod touch and also my ipod nano and have enjoyed them i also factor in though that my ipods have equalizers so the sound might seem better the reason i would deduct a star is they do sound a tad the seal does not form well and i found myself having to readjust them to hear the songs better i have listened to classical pop and metal with them does not seem to matter what type of music they all sound goodfor the price i am surprised i did not locate these sooner again i have bought headphone that did not last for this price without the case and extra fittings i think they are a wonderful value and perfect to travel with or take to the gym definitely something that could be replaced if you lost them but you are still getting a good sound with a secure case in the meantime i plan to keep these in my purse since i take my ipod touch out with me a lot with such a small case to carry the headphones in i will always be prepared without feeling like i am lugging around too much
i was slightly nervous to purchase this but all the great reviews convinced me this was a good buy now that ive had a little bit to test it i would say this meets and exceeds my expectations for this product i am using a samsung series laptop with an i processor there is no lag no delay no performance decrease at all i have gb of ram and this adapter seems to use about to mb of ram this is fine with me to allow me to have a third screen honestly if someone were sitting at this laptop right now and using the screen connected through the plugable adapter they would have no idea this screen is usb powered i am using windows bit with usb and attached is a screen running xp just as i hoped i can not even understand why some people had trouble installing and using this adapter here is what i did as soon as i plugged the adapter in i went to the page plugable emailed to me downloaded the latest windows driver installed it restarted the computer and the screen was immediately attached and working i didnt have to manage any settings i expected to at least have to activate the screen nope theres literally no guess work involved it took me about minutes to have it up and running i recommend this product im so glad now that i bought twointeresting to note may be that i did not use the cd provided i ignored its existence as i do with every tech item i buy online of the time its always best to get the latest driver from the manufacturers website if you did not know that remember that
small in size but tough and simple the chromebox will do all the browsing you could ask for if youve used a chromebook before you know what youre getting yourself into as it is very much like anything else involving chrome os speed is sufficient and the ram handles the job just finethe only problem im having right now involves the peripherals im using with the chromebox im using a samsung hdtv with hdmi input but its actually extremely big for what im doing i would have been happy using my computer monitor but the output closest to that is the displayport which would need a vga adapter cable so ill need to research into that if i cant get used to the current setup the keyboard is a microsoft and the mouse is a logitech both of which work excellent just plugged them both in and they worked right away in cordless fashion thats right no drivers needed if youre on the fence think about what you do with a computer on a daily basis google chromes operating system does not require an antivirus program to bloat up its performance nor keep you safe so you can rest easy knowing this the internet on google chrome is snappy and i like that if youve ever used google chrome before youve already experienced google chrome os but i wanted something that was incredibly simple to use without any bloated software or crazy updates every update google pushes out there is important and essential and not a waste of space it only takes seconds tops for starting up and shutting down or restarting if you want to talk games all of the ones ive played have worked quite well on it also if youre worrying about the lack of microsoft support for wordexcelpowerpoint they just released an app on the google app store for word online which is absolutely cool and now excel more on the way all for free you just cant go wrong now this was a big worry for the microsoftersit just works my mominlaw complains so much about her desktop and laptops talking to her about the chromebox is giving her a newfound interest in this product and im hoping to show it off to her because i think it would be the perfect candidate for her
i bought this tamron lens months ago and ive taken well over pictures with it i was debating between the nikkor or the tamron and it came down to cost ive not been disappointedif youve got the cash go for the nikkor and sleep better knowing you own the best i sleep better knowing my pictures rock just as hard and i saved a thousand buckscheck out my blog and judge for yourself if its a wide shot it was this lens and for that matter its usually on an old d its all about the lensi did put out the cash for the nikkor no regrets there either
not always the first one to jump on the bandwagon i was definitely leery about spending a bundle of cash on an hd set when my tube tv seemed just fine this is of course until amazon and other retailers had this baby available earlier this year at a fantasticunbeatable really pricenow i warmed to the idea but again i need to know what exactly im doing with my hard earned cash i spent countless hours not only deciding the lcd vs plasma vs dlp debate i settled on plasma but which brandsizeetc i definitely wanted to stick with until the next and technology craze bitesi concluded the panasonic thpxu was the way to go not only do multiple professional reviews give panasonic props for displaying the truest blacks but they also produce a plasma which should have the capacity to run approximately hours a day for the next years for the price compared ot lcd at the time it was a nobrainer for meso while im not much for opening new credit cards i did accept amazons offer to create a credit line for no interest over a period of six months to sweeten the deal i also received amazons white glove delivery service a absolutely fantasticfour months with the new tv and im smitten it looks great and connected nicely with my denon av surround receiver blue rays look great as do the new episodes of lost and as im sure it will when the cubs win the series this year cant believe it took me so long to come around and i have absolutely zero regrets trusting panasonic with my television needsi should say i do not use the tvs audio this is not because the sound is poor its actually outstanding i just prefer to put my full audio system to use
just got these today and was looking forward to great sound quality it is absolutely awful i cant understand anyone saying that the sound was great for even a moment i knew the sound was inferior immediately i compared it several times to other standard earphones and they all sounded better than the jbuds i would rather have the more uncomfortable earbuds with a more superior sound i really hate giving a negative review but i can find no redeeming quality except that the jbuds are more comfortable in my ears i will keep searching for earbuds with a great price but ones that do not fall short on quality i enjoy listening to music too much to settle for such terrible sound these buds deserve zero stars update i was wrongthese earbuds are great i just used these by chance and realized that i was just placing them in my ear instead of securing them in my ear canal by securing them properly in my ear canal the sound is fantastic just what i was looking for and i am very pleased and satisfied the bass is wonderful and the sound is very clear and crisp the jbuds compare favorably to a very good set of samsung earbuds the jbuds are infinitely more comfortable happy listening
hii have had this television for just over one year now and it has worked out very well for me i originally purchased this hardware as the sole monitortelevision for a studio apartment and it has since traveled with me to my current living situation the resolution is capable of those above p which works out well if using the pc inputspeaking of inputs it really seems to have a nice amount for the particular size with component composite hdmi and pc there are definite options for connecting an array of devices at one time for instance at one time i had an xbox cable box wii and computer all hooked up the input buttons on the remote made for very smooth transition between each in terms of audio it offers the standard redwhite connection a pc audio input and one optical audio connection i hope you find that as sufficient as i didfor those who like to really customize the color and audio experience you will not disappointed as this television offers very specific customization options leave a comment if you are interested in learning more about this particular featurei can understand those who are frustrated with the amber vizio logo that stays on even within standby mode perhaps you might find thebelkin conserve switch fcq energysaving surge with remotea valuable tool in not only getting rid of the standby glow but also saving on electricity in general i own this as well and really like itfor now i would like to conclude with the reason as to why this television has not received five stars despite my satisfaction with it i can not recall when i started to notice this but the television set makes a definite humming noise it is not so obnoxious that i can not stand it but it is worth mentioning because when the room is quiet one can definitely hear it now most televisions make a humming noise yep even your own but i dont want anyone to be surprised as this one will toothanks for reading and if i can be of any more assistance please leave a commentsean
i think the brand is promising but did not deliver in terms of breadth of sound i use these to work out and the cord is too long it would be nice if it had some sort of winding device but i have to bunch the cord in my pocket its long enough to extend several feet which is rather irritating if you like to exercise wthese headphones the sound is bassresponsive as promised though a bit much for me i think sony has more of a range in sound though these headphones do isolate sound better if that matters to you more than sound quality i would not purchase again still looking for a quality headphone set that is comfortable for gym use no behindtheneck passe style that gets annoying the earpads are adjustable you just have to tug slightly on them to extend the distance from the top of the headband to the earcups
giving a bad review because you didnt research or understand a products use only makes you a bad reviewerthis product does what it claims cuts flash recycling time down so you can fire at a faster rate or at least not have to wait as long for the flash to be ready it does this by adding a th battery to the sb ingenius i was a little nervous bending the standard sb battery door beyond to remove it i went slow and as it bent back the little prongs popped outeasy place x new battery into the sd and x new batteries into the sb align the marks and slide it on until it clicksmake sure you use new batteries or matched batteries if using rechargable
these earbuds arent bad but theyre not great either jlab lists them for but i got them for and some change with a giftcard i got for my birthday i went from a pair of jvc marshmallows to these and other than the treble being slightly better on the j fis there is no difference in mids or bassthe included silicone tips are pretty good i got a great seal with them which helps with the bass however i had a problem with the left earbud i hear the driver tick out of place and lose audio basically the seal creates a vacuum in my ear canal and pops the driver out of place i can push in and hear the speaker tick back into place my marshmallows did this at first but stopped for whatever reason its been a week and the j fis have yet to quit this bad behavior in fact i think its gotten worsei have the idea of trying some foam tips and seeing if they are any better comply makes some tips that are compatible with these buds so ill probably get some of them one dayas far as sound goes the j fis opened up after listening for a week they were tinny at first but the mids and bass became more obvious with use that said the bass isnt enough for my tastes they do have a warm sound but seem muffled to me if that makes any sense i feel kinda meh about them in general theyre definitely not as high quality as they are hyped to be and i would not recommend anyone get them unless they were marked down to or less
friend of mine has an old pc with gb of ram and winxp last month he asked my help to upgrade to win for added functionality i told him he needs gb ram if he really needs a fast pcso i went to look for a place to buy ddr thats not faster than mhz ie pc since his mother board is wont accept newer modelsthe only company that carried such model was komputerbay so i did put the order and got the modules once i got them i went a head and installed the two dimms switched on the pc and windows is stuck on boot logo i did a lot of checking and found that it was the new dimms after more checking i found the bios is very old on his optiplex gx so i went a head and upgraded the bios and that solved the issuethanks komputerbay
heres are the positives its dirt cheap and beats all its competition in price has x optical zoom uses inexpensive easy to find nimh aa batteries light weight downloading pics on win xp is very easy you dont need to buy any ac adaptor or card reader included cable works great the manual is easy to read and understand the menus on the camera itself are very easy to use and navigate nice sharp well focused daytime picshere are some negatives too thick to put in any pocket except maybe a big winter coat uses a propreitary and expensive xd card this adds to cost and makes tougher to recommend it lens has very slow startup time and takes long to retract back i feel its slower than even poor low light performance mostly the white balance brightness is wrong have to fiz each picture in photoshop theres no tv output on this what a shame the movies recorded dont have sound and are not so great cheap and low resolution lcd screen fuji cut too many features compared to on this smaller lcd size no nimh batterycharges included slow startup times etc poor build quality last yrs failed due to many things like stuck lens and battery leaked charge seems likely to have same troubleswish fuji had made this thinner by about used a standard compact flash card instead of propreitary xd card had a tv out better white balance and quality control my is going back to store i had rather buy a canon or nikonif you dont mind being stuck with a dead camera on a trip and dont mind above shortcomings its a good buy overall if you on a tight budget or a first time buyer you can go for this otherwise look for something worth your time and money
my midland radios were acting very strange not transmitting correctly and cutting out the battery would only last about an hour before it would quit no matter how long we charged them we decided to try these batteries and are so glad we did these were a very low cost option to purchasing new radios these arrived quickly and with a partial charge already on them they are an exact replacement for what came with the radios and after a quick change out with the old battery the radio jumped to life and works better than it has ever worked

installed this connecting to a netgear wndr i recommend starting the driver only and then restarting your computer for best results the included utility includes functionality to turn your computer into a wireless access point the driver on the included minicd worked fine and i checked the tplink website and there is no newer driver if you have windows there is a beta windows driver available on the websitei tried to gauge how fast this card actually is so i performed a lan speed test to a server connected via high speed cable connection directly to the router the test reported mbps write and mbps read
when it worked it was great on a hot august day it melted and no longer works at least it did not start any fires i would not leave it plugged in if i were youi use this with a sansa fuze and later an ipodturns out that the normal channel i set this to is a radio station somewhere south when plugged in the radioplay over powers the distant station this thing works and works well since it overpowers the station i leave it where it works and dont worry about it i did have to change it that time we drove to chicago thoughthree buttons to assign a station to and any channel no restrictions on what channel you choose to set the transmitter tothe only thing i can pick about is that the other buttons on the transmitter get pushed when i set something on the control or the wife sits on it
these are great looking speakers compact glossy and elegant the volume is adjusted by spinning a disc on the top of the unit its hidden from view and works very well other than that just plug it in and go the sound quality is good comparable to the jbl duet although the duet seems to me to be more powerful the jembe may have better base and depth either way for a set of computer speakers the sound is above average jbl makes consistently good speakersthe jembes party trick is its auto onoff switch instead of leaving your speakers turned on all of the time the jembe will detect a signal on the audio jack and turn itself on this saves electricity in practice this feature is kind of annoying because it takes to seconds to turn on
i couldnt believe it without running the cd setup deal i was already on the internet this has got to be the easiest setup around great signal strength as far as i can tell use bandwidth place and speedtestnet speed tests both show almost as much as my wired speed using wireless my one bedroom apartment and my neighbors apartment same floor two doors down on the other side of the hallway my neighbors one floor down about two doors down on and on the other side of the hallway about to mbps my connection is mbps not too shabby for an inexpensive router this replaced my old faithful wrtgl i wanted n for some reason
for the price this is a worthwhile cover and does what it is said it will to do i very much appreciate how easy it is to open and shut with it going directly into sleep mode i did not give it a star rating as i learned that i need a cover that makes it easier to hold while reading my galaxy is wonderful but is a bit heavy to grasp for any length of time this cover is fine if you hold it in your lap but if in bed holding it with one hand i find i should have one that has a strap over my hand or something so it doesnt slip ill keep this and get one with a strap this cover is easy to pop in and outill make use of both
first of all i have owned many different subwoofers jbl mtx jl audio audiobahn kicker alpine lower end and a few cheap models over the years is it the best sounding subwoofer i have ownedno is it the most expensiveno am i happy with ityesit is however the first subwoofer i have put it a ported box i built the box to alpine specs for cubic feet and slot port dimensions i think that it would sound better in a sealed box but it might be some of my settings i am waiting to install my new channel to retune the system maybe it will be betteri am running a r f amp at watts sustained power no clipping i would definitely not push it with any more that that i have smelled the sub a couple times if you plan on running watts at a ohm load get of the ds and wire them into a ohm load you will be happier and they will last longeri also put one in a hatchback with a watt kenwood mono amp that is all you need for a hatchback unless you dont care about sound quality and you are one of those that want to flex glass and metali usually spend more on the speakers inside the car for a quality sound and add the sub after to get the right amount of punch for the average volume i listen to this car is the same way i was looking for a single sub that would replace the i had to get some of my trunk backi do have children and it is my daily driver and grocery getteri found exactly what i was looking for in this subwoofer
cksmith is fun but very different from the first one carrer mode is gone and now you focus on mastering the songs i find the song list to be great it has a lot of rock and metal tracks on it just make sure that you read the song list before buying this isnt the worlds best way to learn how to play guitar it doesnt really teach you notes or positions it just teaches you how to read tab kinda and play songsi have been playing guitar for years and i find it is a great way to warm up before practicing or learn songs without getting boring for what it is i like it i love both guitar and video games and this is both in one package
this is a great product but you may need to know how to change windows registry values to make it work the way you wantin my case installation went without a single problem though i should mention that happague really needs slightly more detailed installation manual for example it is not easy to identify all connectors and adaptors supplied with the product i spent some time trying to discover composite video input and then searching for composite to svideo adapterafter installation i discovered that card apply too much amplification to the audio channel so recordings have lot of distortion it was easy enough to google out site with all tips and tricks for the card but you should be confident enough to modify registry on your machinei wish happauge provided some simple user friendly utility for tuning the boardbundled sofware is ok it does what it suppose to do but if your want more functionality try sage tv for tv and ulead video studio for home videoin general board works great and i have no issues so far
these are three dimensional slightly stickytacky sheets that collect and trap dust dirtsand and hair this particular listing is for a large quantity dispenser boxes full for a short video on how it works search youtube for easy trap these duster sheets can be used with a specially designed holder which i did not have it is rather pricey the advantage of the special holder is that it allows you to easily use both sides of the duster sheets however you can also use these disposable duster sheets by applying them to whatever duster you use right nowfor the cleaning the floor i tried attaching it to the bottom of a swiffer first i put on a clean disposable swiffer cloth so it would have something to stick to then i just laid the easy trap cloth right on the swiffer cloth there is no need to wrap it around and attach it because the slight stickiness makes it stay it worked great and definitely picked up more debris than a swiffer pad would once it was full of debris i removed the cloth folding the dirty sides together and used the nowexposed clean sides to do a little extra dirt pick upnext i tried dusting walls and objects with it by sticking it onto my handheld duster i used it with anoxo good grips microfiber double duster again it worked great possibly even better than it did on the floori also tried simply holding the cloth in my hand and dusting with it this worked but it felt a little funny since it is slightly sticky it did not seem to leave any residue on my hands this might be useful for detailingit claims to be useful in wet situations but i did not test that outi do like it and will buy it again but next time i would prefer to get one box at a time the great thing is that it does not scatter dust all over it holds it really well
i purchased this auxiliary cable to use primarily with my ipod in my car prior to this cable i had one of those retractable ones that worked perfectlyor so i thought until i received this one wow what a difference this cable makes in the sound quality the music sounds much clearer more crisp its totally awesome at first i thought it was just my imagination but then i did an actual back to back sound test using the two different cables yup this one produces a higher quality sound it comes coiled fairly tight but can be stretched up to a total length of feet i uncoiled mine and it did stretched to just about feet once i released the cable it bounced back to it original length though i can not say if that would still be the case if i had kept it stretched for an extended period of time i really dont need that much length in my car due to the location of the auxiliary output i only purchased the feet cable as opposed to the feet in the event i ever need the longer lengthsuch as if i were to switch cars in any event i liked the coil feature as it keeps the excess cord retracted and out of the way a problem i had once my so called retractable one stopped working so overall this cord is attractive with its slender profile and tight coil and it works great fits my need ideally
nice little pack of cables very nice purchase for under i was concerned they may be to short but i found the size worked well for my setup issues to be mindful of however the end has no clip action it just plugs in im not concerned about it for myself but it wont lock in place and may be something that could come loose if your a tinkerer in your case the end is backwards from what i have used in the past the cables i have used before have always pointed down when plugged in this points up so hoking up a dvd drive that would go higher in your case will take away from the length of the cable because it will have to aim upwards and be gently folded back down to get to your sata connections on the motherboard for my drives this was no issue just something noteworthy
ts of people make screen protectors and they are seemingly all the same here infinite products differentiates themselves by including two screen protectors in the same package this one went on the ipad that is normally used by my daughter was quite easy to apply although the including cloth wasnt very good so i used my own microfiber the plastic squeegee wasnt great either which is kind of par for the course here but it worked bubbles came out easily edges had a few issues but the case that is on it cover it up great way to protect from little fingers or big fingers and other damage wont prevent it from breaking but might protect it from being scratched
this really is a lovely grey case with leather accents that is very light for many of us who own mac airs we do not want to add a lot of weight to them this case is the perfect solution i can carry this case under my arm or throw it into my briefcase it is well protected just dont drop it as the case is made out of a very heavy felt material the inside has two compartments and is a suede type material that will prevent your mac from getting scratchesthe back of the bag has two outside pockets for your phone pens calendar or even car key the quality is much better then it would have expected for a case it is very nicely stitched and it does not look cheap at allthis really is a very nice case especially with such a low price point i can recommendi received a sample to test but the review is my own unbiased opinion
ive been using this as the cord to connect by phone to the car charger i like the coiled design to reduce space and tanglingthere are two downsides to this product the micro usb ends housing is huge i have a case on my smartphone with ample cutout for the micro usb cord but this cords huge housing gets caught on the case and makes the cord insert at an angle im not a fan of this as it puts undue stress on the usb connection and over time can cause the usb port or cord to fail ive had this happen on accident on an earlier smart phone i was able to do some dyi modding by trimming the housing near the micro usb end down a cm or two with a box cutterthe other downside is that the cord is too stiff because the stiffness and lack of elasticity the cord will not easily retain its coiled shape once youve stretched it out this will occur on the very first time you use it it still stays coiled afterwards but the overall length when coiled will gradually increase the more you stretch it
so i just got my iphone and wanted to put on a screen protector i am using the speck candy shell grip as the case and its really protects the rest of the phone very well but of course the screen is exposed i had tried zagg as well as some cheap protectors on other phones and never really satisfied i also was looking seriously at the glasst model as well as the liquid protectors which claim to be quite goodthe glasst is very nice but it adds enough height that my case wont work with it so i ruled it out the zagg didnt have a great feel to it so ruled that out i found the tech armor here and saw quite a lot of positive reviews the price was right plus you get three so even if you mess up you have another shot or twoso i procrastinated for a while but finally took the plunge today and installed it first the fit was very good the plastic fits the phone face very well so no overhanging edges lineup of the upper earpiece slots wasnt perfect but good enough i made sure the home button as well as the sides were perfecti used a method i saw on youtube which shows you how to place the protector on the screen line it up then use a couple of pieces of tape to hold one side opposite the side you will expose that keeps it from moving and then you simply pull the adhesive tab cover off have to say that the protector seemed to really work almost by itself once adhesive was free i do have one small dust spot near top and the bottom right corner edge isnt stuck but overall the fit and adhesion is very goodas for the clarity and touch feel i think they are well above average hardly any difference in the clarity of retina display and sensitivities of touchso since this is first day i can not speak for durability but considering i have the other two still as spares i am comfortable that this was a very good valuetake your time and clean the screen and try the scotch tape method seems to be a nice way to keep it exactly in place while exposing the adhesivei doubt i will try to use the lifetime warranty since i am sure some shipping costs will be involved but even if it lasts only a few months i am still good for a year of protection at a small price
this is a great slim case for the sero pro tablet the tablet fits perfectly and the cover can be folded all the way back so i can still use the sero in a car mount the biggest drawback as many others have said and the reason for four instead of five stars is the flimsy plastic latch mine cracked after only three days use and broke completely after about seven days rather than get a replacement case just to have the same latch problems i salvaged a piece of thin elastic cord from a wornout pair of river sandals from a famous uppermidwest catalog company that was purchased by a major retailer that used to have tall building in chicago with their name on iti cut out the broken latch piece and used a needle and thread with the thread looped around the elastic cord to get the cord through the elastic band on the case i then tied a overhand knot in the two ends of the cord i will eventually cut off the ends but i am leaving them on for now to see how much adjusting the knot might need
in an effort to suck more of my money into their coffers time warner cable and all the cable companies now charge for the rental of their equipment that would be acceptable if they actually kept their equipment updated unfortunately they wanted to charge for the use of a five year old device docsis standard so not channel bonding as a result they wanted me to pay for a piece of gear that did not reliably provide either the upload or download speed for which i payso it was time to stick it to the man here in the raleigh nc area time warner cable supports this device i purchased it for a reasonable amount i expect that in two years it will pay for itself if that replacement was the only thing i was doing but i also changed from the digital phone to ooma phone service and in the upcoming year i will drop my tv service why well this device provides consistently good throughput so we will switch to web access for some shows we will use netflix and hulu plusthat should cover of what we want and it will be a lot less expensive
i saw several splitters here at amazon i was really apprehensive about getting this splitter because it was so inexpensive i saw brand name splitter for over and quality is often synonymous price but i figured what the heck its only it wont break me this splitter worked excellent i have an ota digital antenna and three televisions in the los angeles area miles from most of the tv broadcast antennas my house is behind a hill and i never got very good reception when i had an analog antenna hooked to just one television i figured that splitting the digital signal would just kill the signal to all of the televisions boy was i wrong all of the televisions get excellent reception with plenty of signal strength and they never drop off of get pixilationif you need a way splitter get this one you will not be sorry and you will even save a few dollars in the process
this is a great little device i used to have internet connectivity with a usb wirelessn adapter but i got sick of always having a usb port taken up plus the old adapter had a terribly bright and annoying blueled activity indicator light this device has a small green led that is much dimmer and works fine installation of this pci card is very easy on my desktop custom computer inside a rosewill challenger case you simply unscrew a rear mounting bracket on the computer case stick the card in an available pci slot screw the screw onto the top of the cards bracket and then twist the antennae into their respective receivers if you have an htpc or other lowprofile computer this card comes with a swappable smallerprofile mounting bracket the fact that they included this in such an inexpensive card is a really nice touch the last thing to do is use the included minicd to install the drivers for this i installed on windows home premium with no hiccups i installed only the drivers as i find extra utilities to be a waste of time overall a great card that even has some compatibility options all for a great price
i read a lot of reviews before purchasing this belt and heard the complaints about adding the second holster etc i like the fact that you can add it when you receive it so that it fits just right on your body assembley was not a problem at all and it you had problems adding nd holster umm i shoot all kinds of things football weddings golf etc this is going to help when i am carrying and cameras at fedex cup championship next week in atlanta and football this weekendtried it out yesterday when i received it and love the way the camera hangs on each side wish i had purchased this awhile agoits a little bit more then i wanted to pay but think it will be worth it long term
i received my case in great condition from amazon installation was a breeze and i couldnt be happier with the case aside from one problem i realized that the included usb cable was broken on my case and the blue shroud that covers the pins was stuck in the header on my motherboard i had to use needlenose pliers to remove the shroud from the motherboard since then i immediately contacted bitfenix and i havent heard back from them despite being told i would get a response within two business days after a little bit of googling i noticed that this is a common problem with bitfenix customer support i may have to contact amazon directly to get a replacement if possible
ive used this a bit for taking pictures of birds this is a really excellent accessory for digiscoping but you have to keep your expectations in check if you want an idea of what kind of images this can deliver you can take a picture with you phone through your binoculars it will take you some time to get the image lined up but it can be done this product will not improve the image quality but it will make it a lot easier to align your phone and your binoculars with this adaptor on i can snap a picture through my binoculars in a couple of seconds without the adaptor it will take me about seconds to get it lined up and then it will be a little bit offcentered the images iphone zeiss victory x binoculars wont hold a candle to a designated telephoto lens but they are better than nothing probably comparable in image quality to a compact camera with a long zoom
i am blown away by this handy little charger this thing has not left my purse since i got it holds a charge for much longer than i anticipated and its small enough to fit in my pocket its about the size of an iphone with a sleek profile and lasts for hours which i never would have believed until i saw it in action i even use this around the house when im on my ipad in the living room and dont feel like getting tangled up in cordsi was concerned that it might not fully charge if i used memoryintensive drawing apps which is most of what i use the ipad for but not only did this extend the use of my ipad it actually built up additional charge in the device itself ill plug the ipad into the charger when its at power draw for a couple hours and the battery on the ipad will actually build up to even with heavy use which means i can charge up my devices using the itorch unplug it and still have charge saved up for later no idea how i lived without carrying around my own power source the laser pointer is also super fun because it drives my cats crazy haha overall a brilliant product that i use on a daily basis
i have two of these now and i have to say it really does the job i listen to mine through the sansa speaker dock and its great for listening to audio books which is about all i listen to i cant really say if it would be good for listening to music but if you are looking for something to listen to books on im pretty sure youll be happy with it i download my books from audible and its as easy as can be im only giving it stars because i find the functions a little hard to locate sometimes but i always end up finding the one im looking for they arent labeled etc but it may be that way on all mp players
some smartphones have a replacement cost of or obviously their owners ought to at least think about getting insurance for the day that drop that phone on the sidewalkbut squaretrade also sells insurance for phones selling for to my phone cost the squaretrade police costs for two years it has a deductible per incident so what if i drop the phone and break the screen the local shop replaces screens for squaretrade has a deductiblei get nothingwhat if my phone is damaged beyond repair my phone is worth minus a deductible squaretrade will mail me a check for they want me to pay them now and if my phone is ever totally destroyed they mail me a net loss for me of so the math does not work very well for a phone that costs or however if you have a new apple iphone yes you should be thinking about insurance
i previously had the boss way speakers the cheap ones similar to this and can say i am much happier with the performance of the pyle than the boss they are obviously no match for more expensive speakers but they get the job done and sound nice you can really hear the highs i route all the bass to a separate subwoofer threw them in my wrangler with custom mounting brackets and they can be heard with the top down on the highway which is all i asked for if i blow these ones like the bosss ill update my review with how loud they can go
s a protectie wrap around case it meets all that i could want but it also creates an incompatible interface edge too thick to mate with the anker ultraslim keyboard case wflip stand for ipads i love the anker blue tooth keyboard and case it operates as a smart cover just as apples does but it much betterback to built hard shell case it is great if all i wanted was protection when carrying my ipad around at it is a tru bargain but returning it with shipping costs not worth it so it just sits in a box on a shelf not being used at allthe low rating is based on overall value to me for others it may do what they want it to do i do not worry about dropping my ipad i have a nice neoprene slip case for that i dont use display protective films at all never have never will on my ipad however on my new iphone s i use a tempered glass protection it is superb
i already had two expensive powered antennas about four years old each neither one could deliver a strong signal all the time without breaking up the programsthe two expensive antennas worked ok some of the time but not all the time on all channels even though i am in the middle of a large city i figured i would have to live with it i was watching a movie and as usual right near the end i lost the signal then i go over to my brothers house he has perfect reception and he is using a super cheap no name unamplified antenna i decided to try another antennai bought this rca basic antenna based on so many good reviews sure enough i hooked this antenna up and for the first time perfect reception high def all channels no drop outs no blocking no boxesi did have to move it around to find the perfect position but i found it i also got the best reception by elevating the antenna itself by placing it on top of a speaker beside my flat screenlooks like the expensive powered antennas are just a waste of money and may in fact not be as good because of the amplifiers etc possibly interferring with the digital signalthis basic antenna gets the job done with it not using a power adapter running all the time it will save you more than it costs in a few yearstry this antenna first before you waste over like i did on expensive antennas
decent price for a compact underwateraction video camera it is true the sound quality is rubbish but i knew this before going in and knew i could remove the audio track and either voice over or put some music on so no suprise therequality of the video is soso it white outs really easy if you go from a shady spot to sunnyits probably the cheapest underwater and action cam you can buy i use it to record my fish underwater and when i play paintball comes with various mounting kits so you can strap it to your head gun handlebars etc
i bought this adapter so that i could use my expensive inear headphones with the ipod shuffle my sister and her husband gave me and also so that i could play music at the shop i worked at the tapstick definitely does the trick for the other reviewer who was griping about the functionality being the exact same as the buttons on the stock ipod headphones that come with the shuffle thats exactly what its supposed to do there is no expanded functionality when the product you are buying is just mimicking what the headphones can do its purpose is solely to open up the possibility of using thirdparty headphonesthe construction is pretty solid the adapter snaps into place firmly when the ipod is plugged in i can see how it can theoretically get unplugged if its jostled about very hard but it would have to be very hard the buttons are responsive although sometimes the play button thinks i did two or three clicks when i do a somewhat undecided single click this isnt enough of a problem to be detrimental to the experience i just couldnt think of any other shortcomings in terms of hardware otherwise the buttons are large and easy to locate even when the tapstick is in my pocketthe sound quality is about the same if anything slightly less since it passes through an additional little system i set my itunes to convert all the songs on my ipod to kbps anyway so its not like im losing all that much also i mostly listen to it while im walking to class or on the bus or subway going somewhere so quality of sound isnt the most pressing concernoverall it is a very useful little adapter to have if you want to listen to your own headphones while using your ipod shuffle rd gen i definitely recommend
fter reading the reviews on many backdrops i was hesitant to buy any where i live there arent any camera stores to speak of except a pair of big box stores so i have to rely upon online reviews i recently bought a kit with a pair of muslin backdrops that were only a slightly heavier weight than gauze not completely unusable but close this backdrop is much heavier material than the aforementioned but still not opaque but its not canvas so this is to be expected however hanging a light weight black backdrop behind it resolves any problems this will be necessary if a window back lights it or it may to close to a light colored wallfor the price its a very good buy
i do not have stock in the company and i dont normally rate things at stars this is a fine product when i opened carton i immediately saw an excellent assy guide all parts packaged very nicely and all parts were absolutely super quality the manufacturer has support and spare parts are easily obtained the glass shelf is very high quality safety glass with the nicest center mounting hub i have ever seen the screw hardware is tops i used this shelf to mount a sony trinitron crt tv that still has the best picture i have ever seen i collect vintage sets and this shelf allowed me to mount the sony to be an extra screen in my family room along with my flatscreen i also use the sony as a switchable security monitor the shelf has a substantial load rating of over lbs it is very sturdy now heres the fine print you must find a stud behind your drywall or plaster even with paneling find a stud i suggest you use an electronic stud detector the single arm is secured with sizable lag bolts that you need a metric socket and socket wrench with extension to install a power drill is needed to do starter holes drill pilot holes of about when you install the very large wood screws make sure you dont drill too big a pilot hole you want the screws going in very tightly the bracket plate goes up first then you attach the arm with a very large machine screw and a special locking nut that will not back out you need large metric sockets or open end adjustable wrench and maybe a channelock wrench tighten so arm is hard to move next attach the glass shelf with allen head bolts to the arm there are stick on cushions to keep set from slipping on glass heres is my additional item i suggest you buy a long velcro safety strap to go around tv or your device and the shelf this is just added protection to prevent a device from galling off the shelf especially if you have kids in the house this shelf is great for dvrs sat boxes and whatever you have buy a quality cord concealment system and you have a great addition to your home i also forgot earlier there are two nice plastic covers that snap on and conceal the workings of the shelf if mounting on solid concrete and not mortar you have plastic anchors supplied i being the older guy that i am prefer transitional pound in pot metal concrete anchors instead you dont want this shelf landing on your head
i almost bought a dell tablet boy am i glad i chose this tablet instead the asus eee pc tmteubk inch convertible tablet is one little workhorse of a machine i have had mine for hours and cant put it downi have ungraded the ram myself it was very easy to do and i found a video tutorial on youtubei was able to upgrade to windows home premium for about bucks got acrobat reader and office professional trial plus google chrome and netflix player loaded up and they work finebefore mods it was a little slowbut since it has been nicely responsivethe screen is a smidge small but that is exactly what i wanted i need it light and portable i plan to stow in my purse and go so i can bring with me to grad school the main thing i want to be able to do that is annoying on a regular laptop is to read books articles and use handwriting to write on word filesi am planning to get a monitor and will hook up to my cordless keyboard and mouse for use at home at my desk this way i can have the best of both worldsread the reviews and watch all the videos about this device so you know how to modify it properly and you will love this machine
ive had nuvis before this s and s so i know garmins but this ones touch sensitivity aggravated me to no end my wife in fact said the other day that if i hadnt spent so much on it shed throw it on the ground and break it into pieces pretty harsh words from a lady as mild mannered as clark kent fortunately im returning it to amazon for a full refund not sure what ill do next but this may have just forced me into using my smart phone permanentlyi really wanted the extra dash unit separate from the phone but boy the phone works way better i found myself in fact using the phone to look up addresses then typing them into the garminwhy bother just use the phone with the headset and rock onaside from that i do love the features especially the lane markers big improvement from my old unitsps yes i did recalibrate the unit multiple times and spent nearly an hour on the phone wgarmin support reinstalling software resetting the unit to factory etc maybe i got a bad unit i dunno but not about to find out because i dont so in spite of all the good reviews
if only this camera had a larger zoom range this is what i keep asking myself time after time i love the picture quality of the camera and the fact that you can switch the megapixel range from under megapixel to megapixels comes in very handy indeed i purchased this camera because of the size just small enough to carry around wherever i go and yet large enough so that my fat fingers have space to get to all the buttonsi highly recommend this little gem so why only four stars well i would have liked a larger zoom and imo everyone has room for improvementciao
i tried to love this tripod my first review was amazing but now owning this tripod for over months its a cheap build the part that connects the handle to the right side cracked after light use and i cant imagine how this will hold up in a professional environment it looks professional feels okay but you will find it has been made with cheap materials let me just explain that this thing looks like it cracked like a contacted their customer service and received no help in fact they told me i had to have dropped the tripod and im out of warranty even though it doesnt have a ingle scratch on it maybe some dust okay but thats not a solution i had to then ask can you fix it id like to pay to have it fixed that seems to not be an option also many tripod companies offer more than yr warranties my last tripod was and came with a year warranty you get what you pay for avoid this tripod and company
compared to other electric guitar earphone amplifiers this fiio is very well made and has useful tone and overdrive controls the builtin plug is not ideally designed for the stratocasterstyle socket it sticks out in a vulnerable way so i attached mine to the face of the guitar with stickon hookandloop tape and use a short patch cord to connect between amp and guitar socketthis gets the amp out of the way but leaves all the controls in easy reach and allows me to remove the amp to charge it or use the combo using earphones was clumsy with the long cord getting in the way so i plug an stereo extension cord into the amp and then into a separate powered speaker also fiio and play that way with volume turned down for practicethis still allows recorded songs mps etc to be played through the amp and speakers while playing along the controls allow for ok sounds and distortions with some growl though not what youd necessarily want to perform with or record the one drawback is the tendency of the amp to shutdown the amp circuit if no signals are detected for a too short period of timeit does this to conserve battery power i seem to have fixed this issue by leaving the volume knob on the guitar set to max and then using the volume controls on the speaker and amp to set my practice volumeall in all a great way to get practice time in without wearing out the tubes in your amplifier or keeping your neighbors up at night and ready to lynch you
i received and installed these speakers the same day i received them ive owned alpine stereo equipment in the past so i had zero doubts that these would suit me just fine the sound is crisp and clear dont expect too much base out of these as they are meant to be installed in doors they are much better than the stock speakers i had in my chevy malibu classic i was looking for a slight upgrade and didnt want to put too much money into my older vehicle but these seemed reasonably priced and im glad i got them you can not go wrong with alpine products also delivery was prompt and hassle free
i am a mobile worker that uses microsoft lync softphone on my pc i had a wired plantronics headset that i was using but i would get the cable caught on the arms of my chair and i almost wiped the computer off my desk a couple of times i needed a wireless headset that was comfortable great battery and excellent voice quality fortunately the h met or exceeded all of my expectations including the fact the headset folds into a convenient shape and there is a place in the headset to store the wireless dongle excellent range is another good feature of this product recommended
small enough to fit in a shirt pocket and easy enough for a complete technophobe this little camera packs a lot of features into a very sleek compact package photos taken with this are crystal clear and look as nice as the ones ive taken with another digital camera that was x the price battery life is limited so purchasing an extra to keep on the charger is a mustthe camera seems rugged enough to handle everyday wear without breaking although a protective case would have been a nice addition canon you got it almost right with this little guy
the metal parts are solid but considered heavy towards entire headset when i used it by holding the wire instead of metal parts often the ear bud parts will just fall and hit on table also the wire is a bit fragilethin apart from these overall i like the designi dont like to use the balanced ear bud the sound is a bit fake to me rather surprisingly the bass ear bud works out better for me i often find uncomfortable wearing inear headphones but cx is really comfortable even for long hours playbackcomparing to the hd i have which giving better stage effect cx produce sound that is more focus and probably because of noise cancellation i feel clearer instrument in musicoverall i will recommend getting this if you want a good quality inear headphone in this price range
i bought this as a deal of the day thing it has been a huge value for me the sound quality is phenomenal and the battery life is exceptional too several days without plugging in and with at least hours of use pretty much nonstop each day i also have it paired with both my iphone and laptop and it works well for both a neat feature that is not listed with it is that it actually works as a microphone for your pc too i note that feature because i asked jawbones technical support if it would work and they were uncertain you have to pair it with bluetooth but if you do so on your pc it has full speaker and microphone capabilities making it a great option for voip conference calls that was a huge bonus for me
t first i had issues the drive was working intermittently i was discouraged i looked up the apple support pages which suggest opening up the disk utility and i saw the drive mount but it wouldnt mount a dvd and it worked intermittently before i decided to yank it and send it back i tried to plug this device directly into the mac mini as i had it plugged into a usb hubwhen plugged directly into the mac mini directly this device works like a champ first time every time i got rid of of the plug it comes with dual usb a male to microusb as they take up of the usb slots on the mac mini a standard usb to microusb plug works just fine there appears to be plenty of current sourced by a single usb plug on the mac mini so using dual usb plugs is unnecessary at least in my caseresponds quickly not as quiet as the more expensive drives but for less than half the price of the apple drive a slight increase in noise is perfectly acceptable
my first impression taking this out of the box is that its fairly flimsy and cheaply made black plastic that does not seem durablethe second knock was the instructions which were vague and at least for me hard to understand no diagrams odd word choices though i admit im not particularly handy when it comes to assembly i did finally get everything to fit together and put my ipad into the holder only to find it doesnt fit very securely the depth means it fits loosely and therefore rattles as you drive it didnt ever fall out but it always kind of sounds like it will which isnt comforting and even when the holder is empty it makes a a rattle sound just bumping against the headrest in my minivanall in all this kind of works but i disassembled after just hours of use because i couldnt take the constant rattle louder with the ipad out than in by the by
if you are familiar with polk audio speakers then you already know they generally produce the finest quality speakers at every price point where they are represented this cs center channel is no exception to that standard rule if you paid the full retail price of a few years ago before it was discontinued you got the absolute best center channel available for if you are considering buying one now for then you are still getting a center channel speaker better than anything offered for except of course the polk cs and you are getting it at a discount no need to spend any more time searching online for reviews and prices on everything in your price range this is the speaker you want and amazon offers the best price you will find buy it it has a marvelous tweeter paired with two very capable full range drivers dialogue and vocal reproduction is accurate and natural sounding that is mostly what centers are used for in surround setups produces a warm aurally pleasing sound when listening to music or watching dvdbluray if youve ever heard any polks then you know these sound great when compared to every center channel in every price range this is a star product when you consider the price point this is a star speaker i also have a polk audio cs series ii center channel in another system i absolutely love the sound of the polk monitor series
i was hoping for a slim case for my macbook pro and this seemed to be the best option available based on prior reviews the case does fit great no doubt about that simple clicks around the edges and youre good to go however the case is heavy it adds significant weight to the mac book also its a bland case it completely takes away the beauty of the mac it makes it look like one big piece of black plastic from the outside all the reviewers raving about how the apple logo is visible from the back well its barely visible you can see it only if you are sitting really close to the mac and that too its very faintfit and functionality for sure aesthetics and design i am still looking for a better designed case but this will do for now
i buy often from amazon but i dont write allot of reviews i had to write one for this soundbar because im really happy with it and would encourage anyone with the following mindset to feel comfortable buying iti am not an audiofile i dont have an expensive tv i do have a nice flat screen and i believe there is a balance between quality and affordability i have owned other soundbars and have usually been disappointed and returned themthis soundbar has great sound for movies and video games the base is awesome from the subwoofer and fills my room like much more expensive models i have run pandora through it and music has not sounded so good in my house in a long time its great when you get something that beats expectations i am not saying this is the most awesome soundbar ever but it is for me
ctually i bought this to help cool my compact desktop i noticed the bottom of my desktop was getting hot this board helps circulate the air under my desktop and helps keep it a little cooler the quality seems fine the fan switch is stiff but im just going to leave it on so thats fine too it has flipout stands like keyboards but when you leave them retracted this provides a flat surface perfect for my use the unit seems plenty strong enough to take a sizable load sitting on it i also like the fully functional usb ports on the unit i give it four stars
the fact that i cant wrap my hand around this case to pick it up and there isnt a handle makes this case a bit cumbersome to use but i do have tiny hands so that may just be more of a personal problem i have another case logic case that holds discs and that one is noticeable more structurally sound than this one which appears to be much more cheaply made than my other case logic case i have filled it about halfway thus far and i have not had any problems with the zipper as others have claimed but thats not at full capacity i will update if it breaks but i think it is going to last a long time despite feeling cheaper than the other case i use this case for dvds and keep it in my entertainment center and i use it a few times a week
i bought this because i have always had good luck with the pioneer radios i have installed in vehicles and radio boxes the first one i sent back since it would not receive am at all and fm was very poor the nd one receives am and fm but the reception is still poor i even pulled it back out to check my antenna with oem radio and it works great sent query to pioneer and their return answer asked if i hooked up power antenna i did not since i dont have a power antenna no other answer to nd query
i got this wifi adapter primarily in order to take advantage of my new ac capable netgear router none of my laptops are capable of supporting these latest highspeed wireless standards and i am not due for an upgrade for at least another year or so so its nice to have this convenient and inexpensive interim solutionthe usb adapter is really small barely larger than the smallest bluetooth adapters that i had come across it has a small keychain hole at its end and thanks to this feature and its compact size it is very portable the usb connection is neither too loose nor too stiff and it attaches very firmly and securely to any of the usb ports that i had tried it withthe installation software comes on a smallsized cd rom drive this is a bit inconvenient as many ultrabooks and laptops these days dont come with a cd rom among those that do many dont have a cdloading tray that you open but rely on inserting the cd into the automaticallyloading cddvd slot which oftentimes doesnt work with the smallsized optical media i think that having another small inexpensive usb stick with the required software would have made much more sense as a way of distributing the requisite driversinstalling the driver software was very straightforward the cd rom comes with software for mac windows various flavors and linux os ive installed the software on an old windows xp netbook and a three year old macbook air running mavericks it worked well with both of those machines the installation instructions were easy to read and follow and they were very clear about each step of the installation process the cd rom comes with additional instructions in multiple languageswhen it comes to performance this wifi usb adapter really lives up to its promise the file transfer speeds were very fast and the adapter was able to pick up the wifi signal much better than the internal wifi antennas i tried to download a couple really large several gigs files from the internet and the download speeds i was getting were on par with the ones on my computers that are directly plugged into the router via ethernet cables i streamed several hd movies from netflix to my laptops and they were all capable of being shown clearly and without any network issuesthis is definitely a wonderful little device and i would recommend it to anyone looking to either add wifi connectivity to their computer or to boost the existing one highly recommended
i previously had a panasonic bluray player that did not have neywork abilities i am tickled pink with the lg bd setup was simple and quick since i use a wireless internet signal throughout my home i connected the bluray unit with thetrendnet wireless n gaming adapterto allow the player to connect to our network without running any cables connecting to my internet connection was a breeze it did everything automatically after searching for the signal i checked to see if there were any updates available but it stated the updates were up to date i own the lg lh inch p lcd hdtv and the picture was so vivid it was like you could almost reach out and touch the image the sound is superb and clear syncing the units was painless and allowed me to work both units off one remote since they were both lg brands the dvd upscaling allows you to view your older dvd movies without any hassles and it up the picture to better hd viewing qualitynet streaming connectivity is pretty quick and painless the menu options are easy to use it is stylish sleek and overall sharp to look at it comes with the hd component cables but no hdmi is included i connected using the hdmi option which is by far the best choice when wanting to have the best possible image quality i purchased themediabridge ultra series ft high speed hdmi cablewhich are excellent cables at a great price nothing frustrates me more than waiting for the tray to open and the content to load up the lg bd loads up quicker and the tray opens instantlyi highly recommend this unit if you are looking for an easy to use network bluray player that is affordable and offers real entertainment at your finger tips honestly there is nothing negative i can say about itwarranty is days labor and one year parts

the first rule of recordable dvds is to know your type or pick the wrong one and you have to deal with the department of returns and exchangesamazons own branded recordable dvds are a good bargain the quality is great i have burned dvds so far and all went off without a hitch thats only a sample size but ill keep this review updated as i burn more over timethe spindle packaging itself is great the only problem is that amazon ships this relatively small spindle of discs in a cardboard box big enough spindles at least and fills the empty space up with inflated cushion bags this is not the way to highlight any environmentally friendly aspects of the product itself please amazon use more appropriately sized shipping materials your customers will appreciate it and you will save a bit of cash winwin
i highly recommend this bose extension cable theres not much to discuss because the product is simple but i wanted to say that i have purchased nearly a dozen of these extension cables both and sizes and ive never had a problem with onei have tried other less expensive brands but the sound quality suffers or the cord breaks in a short period of time by contrast bose is reliable and durablethe cable is long enough to span most normal size rooms in a house its very useful if for example you want to watch your tv using a pair of headphones and the headphones dont reach to the tv set this cable will span the gap its worth noting that this cable doesnt need to be used with bose products it will work with any product that has a mm audio jack
i bought this camcorder to record the birth of my daughter and must say was very happy with the results i think it looks far better than the previous panasonic range and has the ois feature they also have improved the lcd screen over the last model which had that awful plastic hinge with a inch widescreen display the camera side is pretty crappy with a resolution of around megapixel whats bizarre is that the camcorder recognizes the new sdhc format but whats the point of a high capacity card with such a dire resolution camera dont expect any loaded software either its up to you to make your own arrangements in that department also no remote for when showing on the tv apart from that a very nice easy to use little camera
s many have already stated this strap does not fit properly on the d a small tab that keeps the bottom plate situated actually raises up over the edge of the movable lcd screen on the d this means that you loose the ability to flip your lcd the entire reason that i selected the d over other models and the baseplate of the grip itself does not seat well on the camerai believe that this works just fine with other models that do not have the movable lcd but why does the name of the product still advertise specifically for the d when so many have already stated that its no good for that
i needed to upgrade from port kvm port to at least three ports to support my two home computers and my work laptop the th port has already come in handy when the kids bring one of their computers over to be fixed againlolthe port miniview usb kvm switch with audio and cables works as well as the port version but is just a little more complicated to switch between computers since it is no longer a simple toggle from computer to computer you can step through each computer sequentially or select an individual computer directly just one more keystroke over the port model so not a big dealit does have a few other selection options the one i use all the time is the ability to not switch the audio port when i switch to a different computer to work on i like to listen to itunes while i work so i start my music up on my home machine with the better sound card and listen to it then switch just the keyboard mouse and video to the computer i need to work with and continue listening to my music uninterrupted nice feature that i had often wished i had on the port kvmthis switch works as advertisedis easy to use and is priced right to boot excellent buy in hindsight i would have bought this device even if i only needed ports as the extra features are worth the extra cost over the port kvmiogear port miniview usb kvm switch with audio and cables gcsu
i was debating whether or not to upgrade from my garmin nuvi to the especially since my iswas working flawlessly i decided to buy the and am very glad that i did if used within days of last acquiring satellites the gps locks in immediately and once the address is inputted the route is calculated within a few seconds detours are also almost instantly calculated this is way faster than on the also i like that it indicates sometimes a mile before a turn not only that a turn is coming up but the direction of the turn this is a great feature finally the speed limit is usually not always accurate along with an indication of ones current speed its like having those speed signs along a road that let you know your speed im not so sure it has an impact on me on the open highway but on local streets it is very helpful to know the speed limit when speed limit signs are not posted also it provides the cue that i may be exceeding the speed limit when in an area full of speed traps or speed cameras also the antenna is internal to the unit so there is nothing to flip up like on the older garmin gps devices if youre wondering if its worth upgrading from an older model i can only say that for me it was well worth doing
installing the marware screen protector for the kindle fire is on par with most screen protectors if you have some experience with it youll do fine i was able to install it without any bubbles i had a few dust spots at first but i just used the bubble removal card to lift the corner of the screen protector and used scotch tape to remove the dust i was disappointed to find out that the marware isnt cut exactly to fit the entire display sure it covers the whole screen but a small portion of the edges are exposedthe screen protector is clear and doesnt seem to degrade the display quality at all while protecting it from scratches unfortunately the film has a tacky feel to it rather than being really smooth i have a generic screen protector on my samsung galaxy nexus smartphone and my finger glides very nicely over the screen on my kindle fire with the marware screen protector installed i feel like im running my fingers over the sticky side of packing tape maybe over time the oils from my hands and fingers will smooth it out but if not ill have to remove it
i bought this because i own a large home and the comcast wifi bubble doesnt cover my whole house the part that doesnt get reception is a room i would like to sit in and surf the internet on my downtime needed a new laptop anyhow thought this would be perfect the g tmobile connection is not consistent in my home but i did move a chair closer to a window and get better reception there however i then ran out of g time in about days with what i felt was a conservative usage over that days i have had no issues with the laptop itself it powers up very fast it goes to every website i ask it to
i bought this hopeful that it would answer all of my fine tipped stylus prayers i was wrong there is a clear disc that you place on the screen of your device i was hopeful that it would come off but it doesnt and its kind of annoying when dust gets under it and you can hear it scraping while writing in a meeting it also breaks extremely easy you also have to unscrew the pen in the middle and then rescrew it together to make it an appropriate size when recapping in a hurry it is easy to break the clear disc tip off the stylus still skips letters when you are writing fast and it doesnt make things much more legible it is not like writing with a pen i suggest saving the money and buying an external keyboard for your device
the led light has proved to be a good portable light source for my onlocation work thats part of my video blog its simple takes multiple types of batteries and comes with three filters i find the tungsten filter the most useful it adds a bit of warmth to the subject especially when doing interviews on the street i also use it in my video blog studio as a supplemental key light where it adds that warmth and fills in a few shadows for the price this unit does a good job ill be buying another one for backup and to help light interiors the plastic housing could be little more sturdy but is perfectly functional
i received these earbuds less than minutes ago when i opened the package i was super excited because the earbuds look really cool and i love the flat cord no tangle design but when i started listening to music the sound started cutting outi thought that maybe it was my phone messing up but i figured out that it was the cord when the cord is barely bent or moved near the input where the rubber meets the cord the sound cuts out in either the left or right ear and sometimes even bothsince i am a human being and i plan on moving while listening to music these earbuds are not for me i got my wife some jbuds js and they are awesome so i figured these would be even better but i was wrong unfortunately going to buy myself a pair of jbud js now i hate returning items right after getting themand waiting for them to come in the mail
though not expensive this product was not worth the price i paid the picture used by the vendor to demonstrate this product shows a full size dslr with a large telephoto lens and a full size flash unfortunately it is impossible to place this rainsleeve around a camera when all of these components are already mounted on the camera you have to mount the flash after the rainsleeve is around the camera otherwise it wont fit even then it is not an easy thing to accomplish because there is very little room to work under the rainsleeve if you have large hands like mine you might as well use a small clear plastic the kind they sell at walmart now with this new setup there might even be room for your head to stay dry along with your equipment in good conscience i can not recommend the purchase of this product at any price
i dont think i have ever been more frustrated with a router this thing cant be any worse software horrible constantly drops packets time to actually give an ip addresshorrendous etc etc as much as i wanted to keep and use this router since for some reason my network av receiver doesnt like my apple express or apple extreme this is just a pos i have spent no less than hours trying to get this thing to work i guess you get what you pay for save yourself frustration and time and spend a bit more for something that a company will put some effort in the firmware on this thing hasnt been updated since thats whats available on the belkin website that tells you something about their commitment to this product or lack their of amazon should reimburse me for the time wasted on this crap
i have been buying sound gear since the s and i worked in an audiovideo store during the s i do not like surround sound i much prefer all of the sound from movies tv music etc coming from in front of me so i ignored all of the audiovideo receivers avr with and for many years i always stuck with or stereo gear i have been researching receivers here on amazoncom and various audio online forums for months two days ago i bought the yamaha rxv for our living room tvmusic system which has tower speakers i built there are high quality goldwood fullrange speakers in the front and high quality woofers dayton audio reference in the back this wonderful yamaha manages all of that very well the yamaha powers the front fullrange speakers and our old receiver powers the woofers in the back with the eq and level adjustments i was able to make these speakers sound wonderfulin our bedroom we have a power amp preamp setup but that yamaha sounds better so even though i am still a stereo guy i love this avr it made my system sound better than ever i am saving up for another one
i bought this surge protector for the timer feature i needed someway to turn off the electronics in my bedroom at night and during the day while im at work as other reviewers have mentioned the timer is a bit confusing and difficult to read because of the tiny screen it allows different timer settings you can set for all days of the week or just the weekdays or weekends there is an override feature to allow you to reactivate the surge protector the timer screen is tiny and if you are not in a well lighted area it can be difficult to see the onoff and ampm indicator since there is no back light i plugged my surge protector behind a dresser so i needed a flashlight to see the screen the cord is only so you pretty much need to be next to an outlet there are prong outlets with timer and the override feature allows you to manually turn on protector during periodonce i set the timer up using the included instructions it worked as expected ie turns offon as expected you just need to follow the instructions it can be a little frustrating but if you follow the directions the timer can be set im not great at following instructions but i was able to set it up after a few trial and errors i like it overall and now i dont have to worry about my electronics being on as i sleep there are three tiny lights on the protector to indicate that the protector is plugged in and an indicator to show that timer is setits a bit pricier but worth it to have electronics turned off just wish the timer screen was a little larger and the cord a little longer overall worth the effort it took to setup the timer
the best feature of this cradle is that it sticks well not only to the windshield but to the dash board i am fairly short so i often have trouble reaching the windshield mounted cradles and can not adjust them easily this cradle solves this problem for methe cradle can be rotated degrees and adjusted in many different ways very easilyi received both f and f dash phone holders from the manufacture for evaluation testing and review this gave me a chance to do a side by side comparison of the two holders what are the main differences between the two how the holder attaches to the dash f has a special gel mounting system which is designed to work on areas which otherwise do not hold suction the gel system allows it to be mounted on uneven surfaces eg textured dashboard which have trouble holding the suction with other methods the gel suction is reusable the gel can be rejuvenated by gently wiping with a wet cloth the instructions do warn that the gel suction may leave a permanent round mark on the area where it is was attached f has a more traditional push level suction with a silicone base how the holder attaches to the phone f has a spring activated clamps the width of the holder adjusts from to the depth of the holder is am attaching a photo showing a phone being held in this holder the depth of the holder works well with a regular slim smart phone with or without the a skin a smart phone with an extended battery does not get a firm grip due to extra thickness of the phone the holders sides only reach as far as the battery they do not get a grip on the frame of the phone f attaches to the phone by suction so it is quire universal in terms of fitting different sizes and thickness of the phone it even fit a smart phone with an extended batterythis holder is best for slim smart phones for the situations where you need to mount the holder on the dash and other holders do not work the down side is that the gel may leave a permanent mark on the cars dashthe photos referenced in the review can be located by following customer photos link under the main photoali julia review
i bought this drive to consolidate my dvd backups and reduce my disc collection by a whopping i found the drive for a better price on a site with an egg in the name i put this drive in a vantec usa nexstar dx external usb enclosure which i highly recommend see user photos above my computer is a year old macbook pro running mountain lion and i use toast with the blu ray addon for my burning software i use the verbatim gb x bluray single layer recordable discs so far ive burned about discs with zero verified disc failures ive read about dvd backup discs without error and i can copy all gb onto my computer in about minutes my computer is limited to usb i expect the speed to be faster when i upgrade my computer to usb so far im very happy with this drive it been flawless with reading and writing it does get quite loud when it spools up to full speed but no louder than any other optical drive ive used the actual hardware burning is the fastest part of the burn process for me i encrypt my discs which take forever about an hour since its gb at a time the physical burning currently takes about minutes and the verification process takes another minutes this is on an older computer with usb i expect my speeds to improve when i update my computer your mileage will vary greatly depending on your systemthe combination of enclosure drive software has been flawless its a true plug and play scenario on the mac platform no software drivers needed all the hardware and software play nice and ive never once had a single issue with drives not being found or discs not being able to be written or read everything works exactly as it should
this thing actually works it does take some real thought and time to program it but the method is web based so it is not as tedious as teaching it with your other remotesthe problem is you have to envision your use scenarios and then think them throughit is somewhat cumbersome when you want to do non programed moves but it does do it all and has opened up some options not on my original denon remotei have put my regular remotes off the top of the coffee tablesome of the buttons could be reshaped for easier locating by feel
purchased the nikon d slr and wanted to get a carry all for it that would not only protect the camera but hold all my accessories this bag does the job and more its like the swiss army knife of camera bags there are several zippered compartments the main pouch the part that holds the camera andor lenses is customizable i even use it to hold my cell phone it has an optional and comfortable shoulder strap overall the bag is very well made ruggedsturdy and keeps everything clean and organized plus all this for a reasonable price at amazon i am very happy with my purchase
kay this is a standard esata dock thats been badged for thermaltake ive seen a lot of different companies with the exact same looking dock however it comes with the great thermaltake packaging and support it has both an esata cable and a usb cable included with it the power cord and cables are long enough so that my computer is at the side of the desk and the dock is on the desk by my monitor the packaging is just another great quality job by thermaltake its worth a few extra bucks over the noname brands that sells essentially the same dockthe esata transfers are just as awesome as you would expect going back to usb is really really hard after youve become accustomed to sata speeds esata is like using an internal hard driveinstallation is fast and super easy all my systems are windows or vista and they all work great with this device i highly recommend it these docks are the way to go because internal hard drives are much cheaper than external hard drives and its a space saver you can have a drawer of internal hard drives and then just one dock i have like external hard drives and they all come in strange shapes and are bulky to store away i buy the cheap bulky external drives because you get so much more for the money than the hard drives so you can imagine with the external casing covering the hard drive its one big package one is shaped like a peanut another is curved with a stand another is oval and each external hard drive seems to come with its own nonstandard power supply makes it really impractical to store away and then you have to pull it out put in on your desk plug in the cable to a power strip thats under your desk or behind it plug the esata or usb cable to the front or worse the back of the computer a lot of stuff to do rather than just grab a hard drive and put it immediately into the dock with this dock i dont have to worry about all this setup just grab the hard drive and put it in the dock
this cable is light weight well made sturdy construction strong and is flexible bends easily not rigid like some are i tested it with my printer and it works great printing is fast and comes out clear ft length gives the convenience of being able to have my printer a longer distance away from my computer and still be able to print this is a nice plus i ordered and did not get the gray colored one like in the picture which i wanted so itd be easily found among all the black wires i got black ones instead but they work and thats all that counts im very happy shipping and receiveing is fast they come in a strong gray plastic shipping bag sent by mail and is delivered to your mailbox love that i have bought products from eforocity many times and always receive top notch merchandis
we upgraded our hdtv and bluray player so i decided to upgrade the receiver too so that it would all be hdmi i found the sony and it seemed like a good deal and it was super skinny so it fit well into our new tv standsetup is easy and the little microphone that lets you autoprogram speaker distance is very cool but from the start the left channel speakers seemed very weak at times nearly silent and at first when playing a bluray the system would shut down after minutes later i found out that there is an auto shutoff if the receiver doesnt detect action why it cant detect a sony bluray player i have no idea but i turned that off and it seemed to fix the problemsadly not entirely i also have a pioneer pdf cd player that is around years old though they still sell this model today it is connected through rcainputs when playing cds through the receiver it may play fine or it may turn off after a few minutes after you turn it back on again it may play fine or it may turn off in minutes in seconds in three secondsafter having enough of this i exchanged the unit for a new one and i still have exactly the same problem i do not have this problem with the logitech bluetooth pc music input just the cd player sonys online tech has never heard of the problem and only could suggest that i plug the power directly into the wall instead of a power strip no dice doesnt workotherwise i love the system i hope to solve my problemupdated to add that ive done a lot of research and suspect that my stereo is going into due to a possible short in a speaker wire why this is so random and why it seems to only happen with the cd player i have no idea but i will investigate and report back my findingsupdated again to say that yes it was a shortapparently in my radio shack abc speaker switchthat was causing my problem i plugged the left front speaker wire directly to the speaker bypassing the switch and the problem hasnt happened since so now im on a quest for a replacement switch but ive upgraded my review to stars and i hope ive helped someone who has had a similar problem
tely i had to replace an ide hard drive enclosure for a couple of reasons i didnt want one that would just be for pata drives since most of my hard drives are getting old and the chances of one going bad on me are pretty good the problem is is that the next replacement hard drive im getting is going to be a sata and i dont want to buy another enclosure for that one too i looked around and noticed there are hardly any on the market this seemed the most popular of the few its been doing fine and runs a lot cooler than the original one and at a great price i own acomdata enclosures for two of my other drives and they are nice but those are strictly pata i prefer the older ones because they are made out of aluminum and keep the disks running very coolupdate just bought another one because for some reason my older firewire enclosures keep going out ill probably have to get another one soon this case is a real help for people making the transition from pata to sata drives this one the hard drive seemed like it had more room than the last one i owned i think they are configuring the pata hookup better on this one
iginally i was weary of buying based on reviews but found the exact same light posted elsewhere from the same seller and it had star reviews so i took a chance i love this light ive only used it times so far but its sweet i bought this for camping of all things lol i have a goal nomad guide adventure kit and an opteka solar charger both have usb as the power out so this light is just what the doctor ordered just off of the opteka which is just a small unit battery equals hour of light not sure on the guide but can estimate it at about hours on a charge this means infinite free light essentially for me as everything is solar that i am using it fromthis thing is really bright i can light an entire room to a comfortable light level cant wait to light up my campsite with this baby i even ordered another one so between the solar units i can really light things up for hours of free light and its dirt cheap sure it comes from china on the but i was aware of that when i ordered it and it came earlier than i had expected weeks before the estimated delivery which was about weeks gamesalor was vendor i highly recommend this light to anyone looking for a cheap light with good resultsonly con i could possible see is the head is light but i can see how it could reek havoc on a usb port if you are not careful just from the weight of it but that could be quite awhile for that to happen and i am already taking preventative measuresbottom line i paid about bucks for it with free shipping came from other side of the world and i am quite pleasedcomes in a small padded envelope right in the mail
my droid x came with a short cable and no one likes short cables size does matter i had to put my cellphone no where near my bed and i had to stand up and walk all the way to it in the morning to turn off the alarm those days are now gone with this cable now i can go to the bathroom kitchen house next door without disconnecting my phone from the walllolim just kidding guys but you guys get the point is pretty long and it works with my charger does not feel cheap like the ones you buy at the swap meet but not as good as the original it charges my phone the same as the short cablea foot cable was at radioshack for and this one for less than will buy another one in case i loose this one
frankly i got this keyboard because it is shorter than the classic goingout of production keyboard but the keys not struck rattle and the whole thing feels cheap it makes a cheap hollow sound when i hit it its not going to bend i dont think so its not going to give me key bounce but im going to get the classic while i still canthe lshaped enter key is a broad l so the backslash key is displaced right where i am likely to hit it when i go for the right shift keykeytronics got the design and construction of this thing wrong it is not a worthy successor to their classic e series im surprised they put their name on itah well at least it came fast
this is my first tripod and ive been using if for over a year now i use it for mysony cybershot dschb mp digital camera with x optical zoom and super steady shot image stabilizationand am surprise the sturdiness of the tripod of course the camera is not that heavy but even with a decent amount of wind i get excellent pictures its very light weight so its easy to carry around me and my family like traveling and trekking carrying this tripod is no problem at allmaybe my only cons so far for the tripod is its a little tough with the adjustments but its tolerable i recently acquired acanon eos d mp digital slr camera kit with efs mm f lensand planning to use this tripod i guess thatll be the ultimate test ill update this review in a few months once ive used the tripod with the canon camera
i bought this hub because i ran out of space on my old seven socket hub i am not a computer professional but i have had of experience i guess that makes me a i use a usb microphone camera keyboard and i use my ipad and iphone all of which that by usb i was having inconsistent results with the old one which was over five years old since i have plugged in this new port hub i have had no problems with connectivity it seems to function transparently i would recommend it to any other person who needs more than seven usb ports
this is the best case for the air in my opinion the only reason i gave it four stars is after using this case i decided that the macbook air would be better to be used without any case this case is verry slim and verry light yet inspite of that it added enough weight to the computer that it made it too easy for the monitor to become weighed down and not stay where i wanted it the hinge is fine without it and opens without tipping back or without any trouble at all so giving it just a little too much weight causes this little problemso i dont know if the tipping back problem was with only the older macbook airs and apple fixed it by greasing the hinge better or if that problem comes after they get a little older and begin to stiffen up hinges can go either way when they get old depending on their design so i put it on a shelf just incase my hinge gets stiff a little down the road
i recently purchased this item for my gb ipod touch rd generation and i love it the case fits perfectly its not so thick as to make the touch bulky but it is perfect to protect the body and make it easier to handle i have a habit of dropping electronics it took me a minute to figure out how to apply the included screen protector strip off the st tab place on the screen then pull the nd tab but once i figured it out it was easy to apply start from the bottom and slowly work your way up like squeezing a tube of toothpaste and you should avoid any air pockets all in all great value for a great ipod cover
y compact and inexpensive these are rather small speakers so would make good travel companions the sound is decent considering their size no bass but clear sound they are powered via usb and also come with a battery pack that has usb output from four aa batteries so they could be used with virtually any device having a stereo output jack the battery pack alone is worth the cost of the speakers so you get good value with this set the wires get a bit messy so i would prefer bluetooth but at this price hard to beat the speakers come with a little bag for everything a nice touch for storage they magnetically cling to each other front to front for protection another nice touch
the steelseries headphone line is mostly known for catering to gamers this is one of the lines models that caters to iphone ipad and ipod users im not sure if the sound quality is much different between different models in the line but i found their sound isolation and overall sound to be very good overall treble splash cymbols mostly seems a little overrepresented in the mix on some of my songs however most rock sounds sound very good though and jazz less bassheavy recordings sounded even better i tested on an ipod touch with eq offthe leather earcups are very comfortable and provide reasonably good sound isolation the interchangeable cloth covers allow the you to hear whats going on in the room its easy to replace the earcaps and i think its a great featurethese are very large headphones much larger than thebose quietcomfort acoustic noise cancelling headphonesold versionthat i am used to they arent noisecancelling like the bose im just comparing their size perhaps because of the size the cans top bar and cord all come apart for travel it would be nice if a drawstring bag came with them though to make stowing them more sensible these are large enough for me to feel selfconscious about wearing them on public transit or at workthese cans have a builtin retractable microphone for use with the iphone which worked just fine on calls i was impressed with how discrete the microphone looked when tucked away there are line controls on the cord which are compatible with the iphone though their smooth surface makes it difficult to discern if you are pressing the middle buttonall in all these are very fine headphones
great camera with a great field of view good hd picture the only thing about this camera is you can view live image on your computer or on logitech site you can view alarm picture on you iphone but not a live picture on your laptop if you are not at home or where ever you can access the router it is connected to so be fore warned if you want live picture of home at work no can do you can see picture at logitech website but they kick you off with timer so you will have to keep reloging in sure would be nice to be able to log into my computer from another computer to view or publish on my website so it can be logged into for longer time other than that is a great camera that only need some software changes
ive used this tv for more than six months now i bought it to replace a similar five year samsung so that i could have the smart tv feature i gave up cable and now rely on over the air broadcast netflix and hulu and other digital media for entertainment i have zero complaints about this tv it does everything i expected it to do and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a new or replacement tv i like being able to watch my old movies and a few new ones i have on digital media this tv allows you to use a flash drive for video and audio files
installing the moshi ivisor screen protector was extremely easy part of the reason is that the sheet is rigid so its not trying to curl up on itself or your hands also since theres a black border you can safely hold the edges without worrying about those nasty dust particles showing upthe ivisor does a good job of fighting glare on the kindle fires glossy screen but that comes at a cost the screen clarity is reduced significantly and i hated it at first i got used to it over time but im probably going to replace it the first chance i get with a clear screen protector i have yet to find an antiglare screen protector that doesnt kill the clarity of the screen id personally rather deal with the glare than ruin the screen resolutionif you frequently use your kindle fire in brightly lit areas and cant stand the glare this might be the best of the antiglare screen protectors but just remember that your screens clarity will be significantly reduced
i took this screen protector off my ipad because while it is definitely antiglare i felt that it detracted from the retina display of my new ipad instead i went for the fingerprintfading and more clear protector although even that has its downsidesif you decide to go with this i recommend it if you often use your ipad in brightly lit or otherwise glareinducing situations read the directions carefully for the application since the process isnt entirely intuitive i got minimal bubbles when i applied using the guide and holding the screen protector almost straight up make sure you attach the protector securely to the end of the ipad with the included strip of tape the first time i tried it the screen slid out of place by the time i reached the other end the screen seemed a little less sensitive but not obviously so after applicationthis protector is best for those who get bothered by the glare of the smooth glass screen of the ipad if you like the smoothness of the glass but still want a screen protector look atm natural view fingerprint fading screen protector for the new ipad rd generation and the ipad nvffipad debbie lee wesselmann
i own a canon digital rebel from and the motor on the original lens mm finally gave out we had gotten the camera just after our son was born and our smartphone cameras while useful and convenient just dont do the same job given that we are going to do some traveling in the near future it was time to replace the lensthis is an ef lens so it fits my camera perfectly and would be a smooth transition for anyone who uses canon lenses although not the speediest one ive ever used autofocus is responsive and locks on with very little hunting around i dont do a great deal of macrosuperclose photography but the zoom range of this lens ends about the same point that my zoom telephoto lens begins mm keep in mind that my digital slr increases the lens optical zoom capability by so this lens is essentially giving me mmmm effective range given the price used from sunset and the range this lens was a perfect replacement for the one that went badby the way we ordered on a saturday and sunset shipped the lens the same day and it arrived on tuesday they mean it when they say speedy shipping
i bought this for two reason samsungs smart features bounceable flash like tilting it backi love that i can manually adjust the flash by tilting it but because its on the same side as the shutter button its hard to have it bent and press it at the same timeit might be annoying that you really have to press on the flash button to get it out but given i use this in bright environments it isnt too big of a problemthe smart features samsung put in is very useful for when i was filming a video for my channelcheck that out on remote viewfinder and others are all rolled into one app on google called samsung smart camera app other apps dont work the way you use remote viewfinder and others is by launching the feature you want on the camera and the phone just does what camera asked it to do the direct link button is programmable so change it to you likingoverall it makes great camera comes with features you expect from a point and shooti am using this pormerily as video camera you want to check the quality of the mic and stuff you can check them out on my channel on youtube
moving files around or streaming them is a piece of cake with this device i downloaded the app and also tried it directly through the browser and things were basically selfexplanatory it has no problem talking to both my android phone and my ipad at the same time which makes it very easy to transfer files between themthe documentation most of which of course is on the drive itself save for a small quickstart guide is fairly clear but can be tricky i was unable to get the app to allow a simultaneous internet connection it keeps complaining that the security on my router is not compatible which is strange considering that it offers that security for the drive itselfoccasionally the wifi connection will drop its easy enough to reconnect but can be a pain
i love writing star reviews when i find a product that deserves such rating i feel that the creators or company of such products should receive a huge or a card in the mail from me hope this review sufficesbeen using for over a year i have a led tv in my office mounted to the wall only wanted to run one hdmi cable with this switch i have a bluray cable box and my pc hooked up turn on the tv then turn on whatever device and it picks up the device that was just turned on have a tiny remote that you can use to switch around no image or sound loss i think it does d passthrough just never tried it
t first glance youll think the music power encore is just another usb charger but other than having the ability to charge usb devices using ac power from the wall in a home it can also charge them using its builtin batterythis chargerbatteryextender is useful for stretching your ipods power when you are almost out of battery juice and there is no ac power avaliable of course it can also be used to power any usb deviceif you have to use your ipods headphone jack while it is being charged by a portable battery you will need this product instead of something like kensingtons mini battery extender and charger for ipodit is not a onepiece design like the kensington but because of that it is more flexible its a general purpose portableac port usb charger and will allow me to continue my skype session without interruption in other words i can charge my ipod touch and use my headphonemicrophone at the same timenot only that there is no issue with having to remove ipod touchs protective case if you have one or having to maintain a certain angled contact between the battery and the ipod for positive charging to take place for me this is a much better and more practical solution to extending the use of my ipod touch and it is also cheaper than the kensington plus you will most likely be able to use this battery on future versions of ipod and things that rely on usb poweri highly recommend it
for the money i was expecting something a lot more substantial along the lines of the griffin case this thing is very thin plastic and i dont see it protecting from much of anything other than scratches the screen cover fits very loose so you have to push it down to the screen to get it to work it is also very shiny it seems to me that anyone who wants a waterproof case is planning on using their tablet outside but in the sunshine you can not see through the glare on this thing at all the back of the case is also made of a very thin flexible clear plastic which would not survive any kind of hit the hard edges of the case only cover a half inch the rest is little more than saran wrap the strap which is the main reason i bought this cover is very thin webbing and attaches to the case with teenytiny thread that will easily be sawed in two by the friction of the case itself for i thought i would get a bombproof case this thing should go for at most returning this and getting a griffin survivor play
this drive does not mount on my macbook pro with the included usb cable it does mount with some but not all other usb cables but occasionally it spontaneously unmounts the power cable may help it connect more reliably but that is sold separately which is really frustrating also the twopronged usb cable may help but on a macbook pro the usb ports are too far apart i will be returning it rather than springing for a power cord or usb extension cableright now this is the only truly mini gb drive which saves it from a one star rating if it works on your windows computer then youre set
t first i was unimpressed it went on wet and gloppy it looked like there was something under the plastic where i couldnt get it without starting over i figured id leave it alone till it had a chance to set the instructions said that minor imperfections would fix themselves the next day it was perfect fingerprints dont show it looks great the only negative was that a stylus doesnt work you cant drag anything with a stylus but fingertip works perfectly dont know if it is worth the price but it is the best shield for any product that ive seen
i have opted to get this because i use two of these mounted together on both sides of my camcorder to be turned on for a wider field of view they are rechargeable and can use conventional batteries also the larger model the slx i didnt know if it would clear my camcorder flip out door this model the slslx does on my dm accessories multicube canon mini hot shoe adapter i wish they would make a taller light bar so it would be or lights wide when mounted sideways on either side of the camcorder it does exactly what i wanted it too at a bargain price compare to expensive cheaply made light panels micro lights and others that are big and bulky and overpower your subjects eyes and cant be used with boom mics simultaneously
well apparently my walkman is now obsolete no one sent me the memo after a lot of research talking to dealers and friends purchased this mp playeralot of in depth reviews on this out there ill give you the highlights of mine prosvery versatile robust with a ton of memory well built and actually more attractive than the other players on the marketitunes does not require membership yet and allows you to transfer digital media mp cd and video and will recognize most discs you put in otherwise youll hafta manually type album name artist etc the unit itself comes with a large for an mp player screen and builtin games itunes must be aquired from the official site or transfered from another computer itunes allows you to drag and drop songs from your list to the ipod without havig to retain them on your computer saving computer space if you need to restore the player due to errors however youll have to reload those selections to your computercons has a mediocre equalizer and output is far less robust than a portable cd or cassette player most use the factory ear buds and are quite content i prefer wide range ear cannons though needs a glass face not plastic with poor scratch resistance hard disks on these units can seize and are indeed fragile refurbished units are available with hard disks online battery life is very exagerrated under normal use youll get half of the advertised time between charges the box data is under really really ideal situations when the battery wears out youll be stuck getting a whole new ipod due to lack of factory support or really high replacement fees if not under warrantycomes with cloth pouch ear buds and usb compatible cord mass market has many low cost peripherals much more than are available for its competitorsso hohum if youre forced to portable digital this is the one my ipod is full of vinyl record stereo and open reel transfers thanks to my sony cdr after months with it its still the best one recommended
yes you could put rocks in it too but for my dslr couple of lens filters batts mics on cam light flash monopod ipadmacbook and more it totally rocks tons of thought on how this thing will get used more pockets than a pack deserves extremely well designed right down to the elastic zipper pull pockets on the inside of the main compartment lid so your gear wont get scratched build quality being made in china had some doubts was way better than expected only thing i can even remotely think of how to improve it would be some sort of keeper elastic for the chest strap when its not in use and no i dont work for the company just very stoked over this product
this is great mouse works better than the one it replaces made by a maufacturer with a good reputation the color changing is quite nice and certainly makes the mouse a real standout over a boring plain mouse silliness aside if you really do carry your laptop around a standard mouse can add some bulkiness in the slim case you usually use this mini mouse simple reduces the size but not the functionality even the cord rolls up to eliminate tangles in the mouses tail perhaps takes a few minutes to get used to but still way better than a track pad or eraser style pointing device now if targus could only provide a smaller power brick ltgrin
i like this lowepro compact camera case but decided not to use it it fits a kodak zi perfectly with a soft interior to prevent scratching has a convenient zipper flap just large enough for a spare battery or sd card but not much more than that under the strong velcro flap there is enough extra space for a compact basic battery charger but the charger that ships with the kodak zi has the unfortunate outlet plug that does not fold down so that charger will not work with this case i like to carry the mini tripod charger battery cleaning felt with my video camera but this bag is not capable i purchased a slip case for the camera and used a slightly larger bag to carry that and the rest this way if i only need the camera i grab that out of the bag and its in the protective sleeve while i roam around for my shots
i didnt expect much from these batteries because of the price and i got what i feared i got a total of about uses out of each of the batteries i bought after a few uses they could not hold as much of a charge and probably were not providing enough voltage rendering them useless in electronic devices such as laptops the low voltages cause my laptop to flip out the screen would flash and the actuator arm in the hard drive was flailing all over the place which is not good plus the batteries were not perfect fits although they looked the same as the stock and were designed for my laptop type they were inaccurately made and have be firmly pressed into place although i wont ask for my money back because they were so cheap i would not recommend these
fter going crazy trying to decide which cover to buy i settled on this one the reviews were good and the price was great too it is sturdy enough that it will protect it from normal activities it is not carbon fiber so it is not going to do much for a hard strike on the cover it does hold my fire very firmly and the strap holds the cover closed i guess it will have a plastic smell for a while because it is plastic after all but i did not think it was all that strong and think you really have a great nose or like sniffing things if you think the smell is too hard to take i like the way it looks and so far i see no signs of poor workmanship or parts that you know will fail pretty quickly given its price i think it is a great deal
k maybe i should give them more than stars as they worked and seem to be decent quality and probably the problem is more the buyer than the item the issue is that they work in one direction and on my tv that direction happened to be in the up position as my hdmi plugs on my lg tv are positioned in such a way that when these are plugged in the cord must come from the top to make these workable make sure and check the direction of your device before purchasing any of these dont make my mistake
before i bought my ipod i bought this first i heard to many horror stories of people dropping and scratching their ipod i knew i had to buy something to protect iti only gave it four stars because it come up short in order to truely protect the ipod inside the designers should have made sure that it rubber flaps that would close any open surface to protect it from sand rain right now there are exactly three open surfaces one of them the most important is on the bottom where you need to conect the ipod the other two are on top where the headjack and the hold botton are locatedif you live in a harsh environment or a deployed to harsh environment iraq afghanistan or other areas such as kosovo s korea or training centers you will want something that protects your ipod from all weather conditionswhile it comes close it does not go the final distancealso i am afraid that the constact pulling in and out of the ipod will eventually cause the rubber to tear i need to take the ipod out of its protective case in order to put it into my belkin car tunesfor the person that said they found it difficult getting their ipod out of the case not sure where you had a problem i had no difficulty maybe you bought the ipod and are using the g protective coverif you want to protect the back from scratches although i do not see how that person developed that problem either just keep the the little removable piece of rubber inside the protective cover
the denon avr ci and its successor the avr ci are incredible complex beasts with a ton of features looking for airplay its there how about mps playing from your pc or mac through the system yep need internet radio or hd radio they are included want a main zone plus two other independent zones sure want to control your ci from anywhere in your house with a free app for your ipad or iphone no problemall of this plus plenty of power all the dolby digital dts etc decoding schemes and first rate audio quality plus the receiver can literally calibrate itself automatically adjusting itself to your individual room acoustics and all offered at a reasonable priceso whats the catch you know that there is always at least one and the ci is no exception it resides in the learning curve in interpreting and understanding how to set and use all these wizbang features you need a good sit down with the manual some patience and a strong drink or better yet a professional installer it can be done but it takes timelets be fair i dont know how a vendor can be expected to engineer a ton of features into an av receiver without making things complex it may not be possible to accomplish anything else because features and complexity go handinhand most of the time apparently no one has figured out how to pull off this miracle and apple does not make av receiversyet sorry but i had to say that fortunately the cis gui is quite good if you let it it will guide through the setup of the features just take your time and your reward will be a well engineered feature rich av receiver with a ton of features and terrific sound
this is a great device i got this for a work related trip that was going to las week it was the best travel companion i took i had originally taken the device for personal use only yet the conference had no open wifi despite telling us that they would have free wifiand i ended up using the mifi on laptops to do live demos and register users i also used the mifi to connect my ipad and another coworkers laptop and all systems were running smooth not super fast but considering that the system was maxed out and the use was heavy it worked great at one point i was running netflix on my ipadthe goodits pay as you gothe badit crashed on my once during the trip and i had to reset the mifithe uglyits g speeds and its capped at gb even though its unlimited after gb they will throttle you down
i bought this lens for shooting softball action in early evening twilight and night games the autofocus is unbelievably quick and impressive its important to remember to set it to is mode during action i forgot a few times and the images were not clear enough the zoom ring is smooth and is conveniently placed i chose this over the mm because the got better ratings regarding picture quality and it has the f the range of is great for infield and shallow outfield but beyond that it needs to be on a tripod or monopod im thinking of renting to see if that works better for my needs ive taken a few shots indoors of my dog and wasnt impressed im sure it is due to my lack of skills and not the lens itself i havent learned to use a monopod so ive been hand holding it while attached to the canon d i dont think its too heavy but ive been getting flairups in my carpel tunnel pain the day after using this lens
ive had of these tvs both purchased new from amazon in hopes of getting a one that works correctly the problem with the st unit was the picture was too dark even with the backlight cranked up to max and the brightness really high the problem with the nd unit is a common problem among samsung hdtvs backlights interfering with the infared remotes to cable boxes dvd players etc in short it renders them useless and unable to change the channels and other functions on the box topsdo your homework and do google search for ir interference with cable a reason why there are used lnc for sale on amazons warehouse deals even at used these tvs are useless if you cant change the channels on your cable box because of the interference
pleasantly surprised by the distance i could transmit sound with this set must have been close to the foot range but was passing through walls and could stick pick up a clear signal was playing from iphone as the sourcetransmitter and receiving the audio into an old tv that had rca input hard to find stand alone speakers with that input unless youre going into a sound system or receiver of sorts occasional fuzzglitch in transmission but for that distance i dont think i could find a better option also nice to have them on ghz to avoid common interference havent tested with dual receivers yet but will post back once that happens
the case logic model qhdc is a perfect fit for themaxell genhd gb portable external hard drive hd black it is lightweight yet seems rugged enough to protect a portable hard drive from getting tossed around in a briefcase or laptop bag the zipper opens and closes very smoothlyon the right hand side of the opened case there is a elastic strap approximately one inch wide that goes from the top to bottom this holds the drive securely in place because of the vertical orientation it is easy to slip the drive in and out on the left hand side of the opened case there is a pocket made of stretchy mesh netting i store the usb cable to the drive in that but there is enough room for other small items such as ear buds flash drive memory cards etclike all products of this type check the dimensions of the item that you are planning to use with it i have an older iomega drive that i was planning on purchasing a second case for but the drive is slightly too long for this case
this is a quick and easy plug and play above basic features styled device i like the shape and lightweight keyboard and that it only uses one usb port to support the keyboard and mouse the keyboards gentle wave shape is nice as the alphanumeric keys are larger than standard keyboards and would benefit someone w larger hands however the function keys are the typical small size the keys are matte finish and the background is shiny black which shows every spec of dust i would prefer the whole keyboard to be matte finish the keys respond to a soft pressure and seemed quieter than my logitech the comfort pad is not padded but has a diamond shape textured nonslip thin covering to it as if to keep the base of your hand from slipping i didnt feel any real benefit from it but i did like the slant of it as it tends to keep the wrists in a neutral position more so than my logitechas for the mouse well i was disappointed the blue light does not glow as depicted in the product description unless you pick it up and why would one pick it up to see the light imho it is wasting a blue bulb and battery power like the keyboard it has a matte and shiny finish which i previously explained why i prefer a matte finish my major compliant about the mouse is its shape and nonclicking scroll wheel its a little smaller than standard which was fine but the indention for the thumb and the last digits are identical i suggest the outer finger side be less indented like logitech as it caused me to bend my wrist more since the base of my hand was raised i found it uncomfortable and awkward i also did not like that one of the click buttons is located on this side i like both to be on the thumb side the redeeming feature of it tracking well on just about any surface is a huge plus but for me it does not outweigh the comfort issue the scroll wheel feels loose since it offers no resistance and no clicking sensation it seemed like it was broken although it worked fine the final negative is battery usage of only months whereas other brands have up to years use before changing that said when you compare features w price points of the major brands this set is a fair deal
i use my computer as a media center for watching movies and netflix on my flatscreen i had to constantly unplug the hdmi monitor cord out of the back of my desktop and plug in the tvs hdmi cord to the computers hdmi out in the back no more crouching and plugging unplugging i have both my computer monitor and flatscreen plugged into the box this box works great you just click the button and it switches from my computer monitor to my tv what a great solution to not having to unplug my monitor three times a day excellent build quality very small and has a nice weight to it a quality product a bargain at the price stars all the way forget a roku etc just get this and stream media from your comp
i recently bought a new hd tv and blue ray player but was disappointed that the remote i had used for my older hd television and dvd player did not work with the newer devices well guess what i had the same problem with this remote after messing around with it for about an hour or more i did get it to perform some basic functions such as on and off and input selection on the tv but i had no volume control channel changing or dvd functions other than on and off but thats not what i want in a universal remote control i expect to get most of the functions of the oem remote on a decent universal not all but certainly more than on and off and input selector the tv and blue ray player are lg products and maybe that has something to do with it but i couldnt recommend this remote to anyone btw the cable company universal works better than this device but the idea s to have a remote that will work with my home theater including the cable dvd and television if i eventually end up with a smart remote with pc programming and online updates to get what i want i might have to go that way but ive had great results with learning remotes between in the past but for me this was a swing and a miss for me
not a bad product for the money it does a great job with its core functionalitysurround sound i paired this avr with some nice polk audio speakers and annoying the neighbors while rocking out to an acdc live dvd has never been so fun the iphone app is fine i guess the airplay functionality is cool the internet radio doesnt do anything for meit works but big deal im currently dealing with some audio dropouts these drop outs only happen when im watching tv and only when i first turn to a channel or when a dvr recording begins i havent figured out if i have a bad hdmi cable between this receiver and my cable box or it theres some sort of negotiation going on between the two devices every now and then the audio dropouts only last for a few seconds and its not all the time its actually less than of the time when they happen it never happens while watching a dvdblueray ill update my review if i find the solution
it is what it is and for the price and form factor its a great speakerdue to limitations the only place i can put a center speaker is directly at the foot of my sony lcd because of it i have less than of vertical height to work with and about of depth the only center speaker that fit my dimensional need and reasonable price is this oneit sounds great considering the price and form factor it doesnt do any bass but thats what a sub is for my setups are mostly budget conscious with denon avr receiver polk psw sub and niles frontrear speakers but everyting works beautifullyfor those that gave this speaker crappy review i suspect they either dont use sub or perhaps their receiver is not doing a good job of separating the sound if you dont have a sub and are not planning to get one dont buy this speaker buy one that has bigger drivers but for me im limited in space and i have a sub so i really like it
t this price point you get a speaker set with a very decent open and clear midrange with a soundstage voice comes through very nicely and floats between the speakers low end cuts off quickly and while lacking heft does have a bit of punch the highs are bit sizzley very good for the price for casual nonserious listening a very good buy but serious listening speakers for me are like the audioengine the midrange clarity is the big surprise costlier pc speakers i listened to some models upwards of are more grainy and muddled and dont have the spaciousness dimensionality quiet background and soundstage these put out these dont get very loud but are good enough when you sitting in front of your computer like all speakers they require some breakin and settle in nicely after a few hours of playing
i tried using the belkin n dual band ranger extender with my main wifi router a belkin n dual band as expected because both units are belkin setup was very easy the problem is the extender doesnt do much placing it where i need it most in my living room about feet from the main router which is in my home office with only one interior wall separating the two the extenders solid amber light indicates that it is receiving a weak signal from the main router ironically using my laptop and smartphone in the same spot as the extender i get a medium strength signal on those devices directly from the main router so the extender didnt help to boost the signal into the living room when the device was located in the living room moving the extender closer to the main router about feet away which kind of defeats the purpose of having a range extender gives me a steady blue light on the extender indicating that it is receiving a strong signal from the main router as it should however in that location the extenders transmission of a wifi signal into the living room is only about medium strength ie not much better than the main routers reach im very disappointed and will be returning the belkin n
k mouse for a cheap replacement the wheel has up and down plus side to side the program to control the mouse switches is free download from logitech the program is not easy to understand but works most of the time sometimes it goes wonkers with a boot up i just kill it and mouse becomes a plain mouse with a reboot it usually works as programmedthe optical part works finei use it with vista home i have another one that i use with windows bit just a plain mouse havent tried the logitech control program on the bit windows
beware seriusxm subscribers seriusxm is going to shut down all its terrestrial repeaters next year and those of you who own the xmp for its portability are going to be out of luck i walk miles every day while listening to the xmpi and the area that i live in is replete with trees and buildings that block the southern sky where the xm satellite resides without the terrestrial repeater on a nearby hilltop i get constant signal interruptions so i tried the antenna headset its a piece of junk it fails to enhance the satellite reception beyond that of the the poor xmpi antenna not only that the fidelity of the ear bud phones is abysmal its akin to listening through tin cans tied to strings and in spite of what the literature above says the volume control is not a control its a simple onoff switch
i have been using western digital drives since them pentium days and have purchased at least a half dozen or more over the years i have yet to have a single problem with any of them a couple of the older drives are still in use in my current system i currently have two of these tb blacks in my desktop pc in a raid configuration as my primary data drive and have never had a problem i am not a great fan of the software wd supplies but i have downloaded from wd the free western digital version of acronis true image backup which works great for all my backup needs tomorrow i am going to be installing my third tb black drive to consolidate the four other older wd drives one is actually an gb idepata drive that is how old it is this is the third machine it has been installed in all of my western digital drives have been quick and easy to install and format i also really like the nofrills shipping container amazon uses to ship them in it is sturdy and very protective and totally recyclable cardboard how green can you get as for as i am concerned western digital and especially their black drives is the way to go
i would like to make a personal appeal to logitech not to discontinue this wonderful device it is the future of smart tvs i preordered one from amazon in september of for i thought it was well worth the money after i installed it and began using it all the time in fact i am using it to write this review when the price dropped to i considered buying another one but my other tv has a tivo attached and tivo technical support claimed the revue and tivo were incompatible then i read an article which stated that tivo considered the revue and all other such device as competitors so i did some research and found many people who had successfully installed the revue with their tivo hd dvrs i contacted logitech technical support and they said the revue was compatible as long as i didnt place any other devices between the tivo and the tv i bought another revue from amazon for and installed it yesterday it works just as well as the revue attached to my cable providers dvr the box of my new revue states improved google tv now with android and android this is a false statement logitech still has not upgraded the operating system software and made the revue accessible to the android market logitech blames google for the delay they say that logitech is working on it and that the firmware and android market will be available by the end of the year i hope that logitech does what they have promised because if they do not it seems that they will have violated the trust of everyone who buys their products and they will be opening themselves up to class action litigation if dlink can sell boxee box for a good but lesser product than the revue and still make a profit then why cant logitech sell the revue for and continue making the product the former hp ceo who announced that hp the world biggest computer maker was dropping out of the computer hardware market was rightly fired and replaced by meg whitman who reversed his ridiculous decision perhaps the same thing needs to be done at logitech
my old alarm clock broke so i needed to replace it pretty quick and didnt really have time to research alarm clocks like i normally do for about everything i purchase i went to target and picked this one up after looking over all their choices it had the amber color that i liked and i liked the small footprinti got it home and took it out of the box and plugged it in i did not think the directions were intuitive i had to read and reread but once i set it up i thought it was great i love the dual alarm as my husband and i get up at different times i love that i get a choice of how i want to be awoken i like to wake up to the radio i also really love how the alarm starts off very quiet then gets louder it makes for a very gentle wakeup i love the amber color although i think even at its lowest its still a bit too bright in a dark room the couple of things i really dont like at all are the look of the display i find the numbers very difficult too read very old fashioned looking digital display with broken up numbers it makes it really hard to read and i hate that it doesnt have a battery back up i just assumed all modern alarm clocks had battery back up these days every alarm clock i ever had offered that so i didnt even think to look and make sure it didall in all its a decent alarm clock if they could change the display to be more and add a battery back up it would be perfect okay well if they made this to charge other devices like my android phone it would be perfect
this camera is uvc compliant and worked out of the box with ubuntu as a vl device once issue though is that the application will sometimes choose an unsupported resolution for the device but once you set that it is fine great deal so cheap i bought three of them the first one i took apart to remove the uv filter which was easy one i got the outer case off to allow for a bit better results in low light i will be using this one in my garage and the other two will be near my aquarium as i am not worried if they get messed up somehow because dont have much in them great price
the price is decent for the specs but technical support doesnt really help you i have had this for about months and the wireless is starting to give me problems when i call tech support they tell me to reinstall the wireless drivers and if that doesnt work to reinstall windows i have had computers from other manufacturers and if there is a problem they walk you through some steps to see if they can figure out what is wrong before having to take drastic measures like reinstalling the whole operating system you are better off paying a little more for better service
the pin wiring is correct for my intel motherboard digital audio works as expected it shows up in windows as an audio device named identically to the digital audio device on the motherboard so it required experimentation to determine which is which no fault of this devicemy only complaint is with the wiring the provided wire isnt long enough to reach the far side of my video card so i had no choice but to put this in the first slot and since the connector on this board faces the video card the wire coming out of it presses tightly against the video card this board is a bit twisted in its slot as it doesnt quite fit in the slot next to another card an angled connector would have worked much better
this is a really nicely thought out keyboardcase it is a hard shell which to me is the only drawback but it is a solid construction with a nice keyboard it paired easily with my galaxy tab and i was typing in an instant while it is not as large as a computer keyboard so i made more mistakes by hitting keys that were too close together it is responsive and the keys have a nice feelit is usually that way with most minikeyboards which is why if im typing a lot ill go back to my computerthe case has a couple of really nice features it has a magnetic closure there are two spots in the covers corners that hold it close just enough resistance to keep it closed but not so much that opening it quickly is difficult also the cover side with my tablet opens up to a great viewing angle that is also held in place by not only a ridge for placement but also a magnet so it stays put really nicelyit does not offer the ability to view it at different angles and it does not rotate for charging or vertical viewing but this is a really nice keyboardcase combo that offers what is promised and more
dered this wii controller as a second device for multiplayer games it arrived in time wellpackaged and complete with all componentsit synchronized well with the console and worked perfectly alas it stopped functioning completely after only one month tried changing batteries tried to synchronize again to no avail the device is nonresponsive no light flash at any moment it appears completely deadit was handled just as the original controller that came with the device which continues to work perfectly despite heavier usage i did not expect a generic less expensive item to be as good as the originals but just one month of usability is ridiculous i tried to save money with a generic brand but cheap ends up being more expensive
straight to the pointthis projector is great because it iscompactversatile connectivity usb type b and a hdmi vgain three rcaslightweightgreat brightnessclear pictureeasy horizontal and vertical correctionthe major con i find is speakers if you want to turn up the volume over half of what is available on the machine then you will get to hear some buzzing along with it if there were just and audio out port this would easily fix the problemin more detail i would say that this projector is great if you dont need a lot of good sound for your presentation or if you choose to use this as a part of your theater system its compact lightweight design allows an easy carrying capacity that will not hinder your back or your space the lumens in both white and color really allows the projector to give you that clear picture that you want i didnt realize the difference that makes till i got this projector the brightness it produces allows you to see the picture even in a welllit room which is very accommodating for a classroom presentationsomeone else may know of a better way to get past the speaker issue i have with this projector but i would find it much easier to deal with if there was just an audio out port that way i could use the hdmi connection to get great picture and then connect to my speakers for even better sound
the ux is a fine notebook with an outstanding screen initially my wifi speed was quite slow until i ajusted the wifi setings to use the higher band of my dual band n wireless router after changing the settings to mhz under preferred bandsee the advanced settings i also set the channel width to mhz see advanced settings i also changed the power saving setting to increase performance once these adjustments were made i have a fast notebook with a superb screen my internet speed test increased by a factor of the io from the hard disk is acceptable some reviewers find the sandisk a bit slow but io has not been a problem for me
i was really excited to get this unfortunately i could not use it it took a while to instal i wasnt aware of any issues during installation when i tried to run the software it started to load but never finished i waited forever i was never able to use it i am running windows xp it says it works with xp needless to say if i cant use it i cant give it a good rating i guess i shouldnt be surprised i have had major issues with every corel product ive tried i thought this would be different that they would put a heck of a lot more effort into it considering the hefty price tag if i did not get this for free to review actually paid for it i would be furious would be making every attempt to return it to amazon
i cant understand how anybody could rate this game over stars this is one of the worst games i have ever played due to mediocre graphics bad framerate i thought i was playing on a slow pc sometimes and excrutiatingly boring side missions i actually bought mass effect first i started playing it and decided to play the first one i figured i would finish and go back to me did not have the technical issues as me did anybody that says the graphics in me is great must be color blind how this game got past quality control is beyond me
friend bought a couple of these for a really great price and gave me one to tryfirst off id like to say this is a really solidly built headset this looks to be of superior quality to both thexbox headsetand theplantronics gamecom xboth of which i own and have used s of hoursthis thing is built like a tank and performs extremely well via ingame chat it comes with a with both an onoff switch for the mic and a volume control for the earphone light on for the mic switch means your mic is muted just to clarify that for some do not buy this without the puck the cord that comes with it has two plug ends the larger and longer end plugs into the headset and is keyed to fit a specific way do not buy this without the correct keyed cord when clicked into place it stays put and will not work free on its own i would imagine this was meant to be easily replaced if damaged something the others do not feature as they are cheaper and not designed for repairthere are things that are a con for this devicefirst it will suck batteries in a wireless controller dry in about an hour to hours depending on what battery setup youre using i would imagine both the noise cancellation mic and the earpiece draw quite a bit more power than the smaller lighter style headsets this is rather tiring after about the th battery swap during a gaming session with a corded controller this wont be an issuethe second issue is a bit more as the rather robust headband will press into your skull and require the rubber endpiece be moved about every thirty minutes or so as it does start to of this may not be an issue if you have a tiny skull but as a hat it gets rather painful to me after a short time the ms and the plantronics headsets i can wear all day and never move this is not a heavy device it is the grip that gets to youthis headset is a dead design and i dont believe youll be seeing these in most stores except on clearance or used if youre someone that has a small head can outside the to pad the rubber end of the headband a bit more and doesnt rely on working off batteries with your controller id recommend picking one up if its on sale for around just to see what a good headset sounds like
kay this game was pretty good in fact as far as the game itself went it was quite possibly the best put together game ever not the best created mind you but the only thing stopping it from being the best was the severe lack of rapping geniesokay so the extra features were mediocre at best but the game itself was terrific it was beautiful and spiritual and had some sweet sweet ninjaness however this game is not for those of us who give up after two seconds of video gaming as the famous jewish philosopher curly howard once said is boggling puzzles initially difficult fighting and references to may prove daunting but dont give up the game grows on you literally for example after you figure out how to work the combat system it becomes real fun to manipulate the spacetime continuum with the dagger of despair or whatever its calledas i stated earlier the extra features are not so hot the documentaries are fun enough but the originally prince of persia is pretty stupid once you get past the silentmovieera sounding music the game pretty much revolves around falling down holes and screaminghowever the game is worth it it is fun in a ninja gaidenish way in fact this game is like ninja gaiden junior so until they make a game with a rapping genie this will have to do
though i have a wii i still perfer my ps i seldomly even play my wii i also have the new xbox slim and i play it but i still love love love my ps im fairly new to this form of video gaming world and the ps was my first intrduction to it and might i add it was an introduction i choose not to forget thanks sony for such an amazing video game and for such a wondeful video gaming experience the ps in my opinion is still one of the very best by far even one of my cousins has said that even though he has the wiihe still plays the ps the ps is to not be undersold or out done
i havent had it long so i cant really judge but this is what i think of it right now the graphics are ok the sound is kinda cheap its a really hard game to get used toothe controls hard to get used to let me tell you that right now its all about timing a good thing is theres alot of different things you can do in edit mode this game will last you along time most likley i havent tryed out the multiplayer mode but it looks ok what it comes down too really is the edit mode cause you can do so much in there make guys make teams rename guys and a lot more the setup screen before the match is cool you can pick alot of different things but my guess is well since i havent had this game long is that it will be a challenge too get started and it will be fun i give it a three cause it is fun and it takes awhile to beat
i have never played the first crysis though id read wonderful things about it i had played far cry and i had heard the open gameplay compared to crysis so i was excited to see that crysis was going to be released on consoles and id get a chance to play it when i finally did i cant say i was thrilled the game is a very solid fps and the graphics are fantastic the level design is also good and the weapon selection is great they managed to give all the weapons a distinct feel but all of that just makes a good solid shooter not a fantastic onecrysis feels to me as a mash between modern warfare and halo it has the large set piece moments and very linear path to follow like modern warfare and you spend time as a super soldier killing aliens like halo what is lacks is the good story elements of either of those games since this was the first crysis released on consoles they should have expected plenty of first time players the game assumes the player must have played the first game because the story starts in the middle and makes no sense i spent the game shooting bad guys and had no idea what was going on nor did i even care the time when a shooter could just be about shooting has passed in this day of blockbuster video games with massive budgets story plot and game flow cant be neglected anymore no matter how solid the game play or how beautiful the graphics the game is no fun if you have no connection with the story or character the whole game left me bored and i had no interest in playing through it again nor really finishing it the first timeif you do want to play through it and again it is a solid shooter i recommend you spend some time on wikipedia catching up on the story at least for such an acclaimed game franchise and studio i expected more from crysis
i have the version of this game the voice acting graphics and artwork and basic pace was pretty decent but i grew bored of console type checkpoint saves a long time ago plus the controllers just dont do it for me with this game so i was waiting for the pc versionwell i spent full price the day it came out and boy am i disappointed beyond the fact that price already fell in the first week the game is not that much fun to play there is no save system other than arbitrary checkpoints how bored are we all with replaying the same minute scenes over and over and over and over again i know i amalso its a rd person view which is fine but you cant really run and aim nor can you jump or duck these are some simple basics that all shooters need to allow full range of movement i dont mind dying in these games happens all the time but i do mind playing the same boring passage times without getting anywhere the atrocious and annoying berserker part comes to mind here where no matter what you do you die times before something lucky happens and you get through itthis is a decent game dont get me wrong but for the pc it is a console port plain and simple no save system lousy controls nuff said
i play every shooter i can get my hands on and this one ive played times and enjoyed it every time most shooters are quickly forgotten but this one will stick in your mind you know your playing a great game when your awake in the middle of the night thinking of the game the levels are just incredible the graphics audio and story line are all first rate and there is a great deal of artistry that went into the making this game it can be a bit difficult at times but no more so than other shooters out there its and older game so there should be no performance issues running it on newer hardware like a previous reviewer remarked it does have issues with sb live cards and i actually reinstalled an older sb to run the game properly the first time i played it ive played the game again recently and it runs fine on the sb audigy its a shame that there is not going to be a sequel to this really fine game i guess the folks at buena vista figure they didnt haul in enough millions
i love how you dont have to stick to the main plot or story although that is fun too you can just go exploring and raising hell all over this s era city love the music and have the boxed set sound track the s gangster movie easter eggs and references are amazing adult themed references and other delightfully naughty things are also included what else can i say just buy the first edition the song running with the night is taken out in later editions upon the artists request trust me this is the super mario bros of the ps
i am a vetren of the ff seris and this game is one of the best i have play ffffx and this is the best the added a new way of leveling up its called a sphere grid you get to choose how youre character grow and you can make him learn other charactors movesit is very simaler to ff in which certain characters are one class blak mage theif assasin and so onthis game is simaler but they can learn other characters moves as you may guess the graphics are the best and they stroy line is a bit new but better and it drags you in square did a good job of giving you a sense of good and evil and its more than saving the world and dosent go overboard in romance as in ff this is one of the best games i ahve ever played and even if you are new to rpgs you will have a great time with it
the games story follows the film almost exactly you take the role of bruce wayne whose motivation for crimefighting stems from witnessing his parents brutal murder in gotham city in batman begins this passion takes darker overtones and batman must constantly balance his internal rage with his sense of justice the game starts off in the himalayas where you learn the dark arts of being a ninja from a mysterious sect your mentor is a man named ducard voiced brilliantly in the game by liam neeson as you reach the end of your training under ducard and his odd band of ninjas youre confronted with a moral dilemma its there that young bruce wayne decides that even his brand of angry vengeance has its limits and he wont join in the sects vision of bloodlust as justice against crime from there the games story shifts to gotham city where you uncover the mystery behind the trafficking of a mysterious hallucinogenbatman begins makes for a decent companion to the film after you spend about seven or eight hours to beat the game you unlock numerous bonus items such as interviews with the movie cast galleries and more but as a game it doesnt quite measure up though it borrows numerous conventions from other great action adventure franchises the elements dont end up coming together very well resulting in a game that feels less than the sum of its parts
before i get this one many online gamers rated this one about because it can not go online playingi personally not so interested into online playing as people just killing and cursing a lot not what online gaming was designed forthis vanquish has most advanced idea of how a scifi shooting game can be i do love this gamefinished very easy mode and also hard mode mannormal is already some what difficultand hardyeaheach missioni am counting death count arount as it can be and there is god hard mode in advancednot sure how many people have that strength and patient to play that modeanyway i do love this game and want to tell all shooting game lovers this game is worthy to play and save as a collection the price from this seller is also very reasonable
i enjoyed the simcity games and felt ripped off with simcity as it was basically the same package as the previous simcity if you love the basic city building concepts of the simcity games simcity is the exact same thing at least they changed the graphics for this one and gave it an updated look for todays video cards but if you look at screenshots for simcity youll see that it has the same rules building types etc if youd like to play simcity again with an updated graphics engine go for this title but if youve been save your money and buy another title sims anything sells like hotcakes and ea realizes this its another attempt to cash in on the sim name
this game brings nothing new to the table this is k with worse controls plus the ability to block shots the presentation is the same the graphics are the same the menus are the same and the additions made do not justify the dollar price tag at allpath to greatness is not exciting like the jordan mode and the greatest mode from past editions and the european teams are not worth playing because they be played in all modesthe dream team and classic sacramento kings have been removed and there a single new classic squad to play with without a doubt this is a step in the wrong direction i been disappointed with k basketball since k but this one just happens to be a poor efforti understand that most resources may have been directed to the ps game but that does not justify a k releaseif take two have the intention to release a brand new game just k with minor improvements it would be a honest move not to charge us dollars maybe but not buy it stick to k
t me say first off that the securom or the limited activations do not affect me one bit i bought this game for myself and theres noone else around to play iti was a big spore fan ive always loved maxis games andve been faithful for them behind the project too ive waited for the game for over a year to find thisthe game starts out good but as you play it youll find its somehow been dumbed down to a year olds game a kiddy game the cell stage is the only part i found attractive they skipped the sea creature stage made the ordinary creature stage incredibly linear you basically walk around while other creatures just stay at their nest the tribe and civ stage are horridly dumbed down excuses of rtss and the space stage is well kudos if youve played that far extremely boring and tediousi dont know who came to will wright with a gun to his head and took over this project nor did i know they were going to make this a game intended for and under but thats what it essentially ischeck out forum boards across the net spore is a major dissapointment for everyone that was so hyped up about it they had a premise for an incredible game and lo and behold maxis of all producers has failedsorry to say it i dont recomment this game personally all i have to hope for now is starcraft ii or diablo check those out
super monkey ball is a nontraditional game the basic concept has no plot and it bears resemblance to the pinball madness games that older gamers might remember from the past for those who are unfamiliar with older games of this type the idea is to tilt the stage with the joystick and maneuver a monkey in a ball hence the name and reach the goal the idea seems very simple at first and it is however when you try the expert levels you will realize just how hard this game is the game is easy to pick up and hard to put downyou will not finish it quicklyone of the major pluses of super monkey ball is the multiplayer mode three starting games are present in which you have the ability to monkey fight which is where you try to push another monkey off of the stage using a punching glove and extras in an arena very similar to bumper ball in the mario party games also there is monkey target in which you try to land a monkey ball on stages to receive points complimented finally by monkey race in which a mariokartish engine is used with only three tracks also the bonuses in the game which are earned by doing well in the main game are fun as well monkey billiards pool monkey bowling and monkey golf puttputt overall the multiplayer is a very enjoyable experiencemusic is good and it doesnt inhibit the gameplaygraphics are decent and dont take advantage of the gamecubes abilities but they arent going to make you turn your head the other way or break any mirrors also the controls are very easy to pick up the joystick is the only thing used in the main gameoverall id give this game stars and it is a must for the serious gamecube gamer
so after reading a lot of reviews which read as i thought i would write a more objective review yes this is a modern warfare game and as such it should and will follow in the footsteps of its predecessors is it exactly the same not at all on a campaign single player level its just as cinematic as the other mw titles but i feel it has gone beyond in terms of tying the stories together and wrapping up the series with a more indepth storyline the cutscenes are fast paced and intense and while they might lack the initial shock factor of mws reddawnish flavor they are original in their own conception those who expected more i think really wanted to see mw repeated the campaign was as long as the others and i never once felt disappointed or frustratednow onto multiplayerof course there are new perks killstreaks etc and they are all pretty impressive and useful i thought it was funny there were several from the game homefront nothing off the scale but at least they are somewhat fresh and original the perks were standard with a few new added and the weapons streaks included some perks of their own which made the series more versatile the character types were all unique and easy to distinguish which in my opinion has been an infinity ward multiplayer plus heres my complaint about multiplayer the multiplayer in mws always seem crowded with useless garbage the papers flying around are a nice effect but every single board has boxes and cans strewn about and junk you cant jump up on is this a big buzz kill no it isnt its just the same on every level personally i like levels which have snow in them and mw has one so far that no one ever seems to want to vote for so despite my hours in ive never played it i thought black ops was horrible at first but then after plenty of online hours i realized i like it better than mw because the crap lying around a level could be used to your advantage and not prevent you from seeing an assailant the level designs in black ops are more memorable and mw has some great looking levels but boring and useless areasthe spec ops mode is much improved from mw and has its own leveling up system separate from the multiplayer havent played it too much but its a hoot nonethelessif you are not an online player the single player is an amazing experience but not for the full price if youve always liked all versions you should like this so long as you treat it as its own mw game and not a repeat of the other two
the ps looks cool the controller is better the share function works great for sharing screen shots video and live streaming to your twitter and facebook etc the games are amazing on my lg led p hz tv its very important that you have a tv capable of handling this awesome system such as the lg that i mentioned the ps only works via hdmi so throw your component chords out the window and step into the new generation additionally lcd tvs just wont do imo you will not be able to see as much detail that the developers have worked very hard on in the games the picture is much clearer with an led tv or betteri also love the different colored lights that the new controller and system emmit when performing different functions the builtin speaker and touch pad on the controller add a new cool experience to the system as well one game that ive played and love is think resident evil in st person on steroids this game is scary and will make you jump and i dont scare easily it is like playing in one of the saw movies i love the graphics and gameplay i usually dont like st person games but i can honestly say that i would have bought the system just for this game alone it is only available on p and pcthe only negative things i can say about the p at this point are that the cooling fan on the unit gets pretty loud after playing for awhile louder than my ps this is apparently normal though because the one on display at gamestop does the same thingmy other qualm i have is that there are not enough games for it yet online or tangible virtually no free games for ps member or incentives for p users at the moment i know this will change soon this is the same way the p was at launchlastly the controller charging cable is rather short and it is different from the ps comtroller cables you can always go and purchase a charging docking station or longer chord if this is a super problem for you fully charged the controller still gives you days of play time before needing to be charged again
i heard about this game from my friends and i must admit at one point i hated xbox girl screams in background well folks it was this marvelous game that changed my mind this piece of heaven owns people thats about the extent of it all the ai is unrivaled by any other game i have played in my life the single player is most definitely a wonderful aspect to the action but multiplayersweet lord aboveyou will not find anything that can even come close to dreaming about beating this gamei literally went out and bought an xbox just for this game and if they were to not make any more games for xbox i wouldnt mind as long as i had halo and i am dead serious about that i think thats enough saidits a shame the rating system only stops at a mere
ive had this game on xbox since its release it is fantastic online its even better the reason i preordered it for ps is due to the exclusive stuff for the ps version off line split screen coop altered maps from the xbox version a new map only on the ps live enabled as of now it wont support as many as xbox on line ive seen as many as people in a room team survival on each team terrorist hunt is my favorite on line now matter how many times you do the same map over its still a challenge
i loved this game i played all the way through the difficulty level is low to medium i love games like this instead of being frustrated and having to buy a manual this played smoothly all the way through it kept my interest had good gameplay and graphics didnt annoy me by making me do the same things over and over again i loved it i also loved the mario and luigi prequel to this on gba its kinda of a light rpg with action elements i wish they made all rpgs like this its short enough to conquer before getting bored of repetition give it a shot its a lovely game
i hate not having my ds xl protected from the bumps drops and crashes that i subject it to so its essential i have some protection for it until the duraflexi protector came out i was using simply a filmbased skin but i like the duraflexi so much i removed the film unfortunately the duraflexi is a bit of a tight fit and would not completely fit into place unless i did the only other small thing i dislike about it is that i have to remove the bottom piece to use the circle pad pro or whatever the xl version is called no problem though it installs easily and quickly without even having to open the lid and removal is just as easy this is a great protector for the outside of your ds xl
im glad the other reviewers got so much out of the gamei found it frustrating that i couldnt move more than billionth of a microinch without attracting another monster encounter on maps it got to the point that i got turned around and confused as to which corridor i was trying to go because you are attacked times even in one room thats ridiculousi got stuck part way through the game where you try to evade a jailer with no save point possible on each map level you have to sit through several minutes of cut scenes every time you die over and over and over againi took the disc out held it tightly till it snapped in half then tore the box and manual in half and threw it in the trash the best place for such timewasting junk i wouldnt even sell this used to anyone
i played this game and beat it in days with no problems but found myself with nothing to do in the campain after i was done finish collecting the riddler challanges and solve the mystery that can be looked up online the combat challanges are fun and difficult the visuals are awesome the fighting scenes with slow mo could not be better buildings are detailed and the bosses are problem that i have is the boss fights you throw a batrang and then dodge you fight about titans bain poison ivy and the joker with with a batrang you never fight scarecrow cuz killer crock eats him you never fight killer crock cuz you blow up the ground and he falls down the hole you never fight harley quinn due to a cut sceen and she ends up in a cell when i read about the game it said you would have to fight the bosses differently due to their size and fighting stylerent the game first and then buy it at a lower price i hope this helps
i have not been playing this game long i received it as a gift for my birthday a few weeks ago and have been playing ever since this is a great game the platinum edition is a great deal however i do not think i would have paid the money for all games seperately i am disappointed that there is no undo button like in the first rollercoaster tycoon game because i ended up using it a lot the load time is forever and my computer moves slowly sometimes usually when i am trying to put in a rollercoaster i dont understand because my computer meets all the requirements for the game oh well overall i like this game
the game itself is pretty good the graphics are very nice and detailed and the singleplayer campaign is pretty good and lan play is good too but i rate it stars because the quotensemble onlinequot network for online play is terrible the community is very small compared to battlenetwc and you cant even join any online games at all if you are behind a shared internet connection ics nat proxyrouter even with the latest patches i still can not join any online games this is the case not only on my pc but my familys pcs all behind shared internet and my friends computers that are also behind shared internet access hopefully they will fix this with a patch although from the reading the readmes in the latest patches it seems like they are avoiding the problemso overall its a good solid game if you like playing alone or on the lan otherwise expect trouble if you access the internet behind a routernat and wish to play online
i originally played god of war on my ps several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed both games for people not familiar with the series god of war places you in control of the fictional character named kratos the games are set in greek mythology though they do deviate heavily and take several liberties with accepted mythology as a work of fiction the games are fantastic anyone looking for a history lesson in greek mythology is going to be disappointedthe ps version combines both god of war on one bluray disc with all the extras and special features from the original games the graphics have been polished up and are antialiased rough edges smoothed out and presented in p at frames per second both games feature their own respect trophy set the results are spectacular given the original material ill state though that the games are definitely not up to the standards set by most toptier ps games also gow is clearly the better looking game though for anyone who has ever played the games on the ps youll be seeing the series better than you ever thought possiblethe two games in this collection take kratos from humble beginnings all the way to olympian deity the journey along the way is fraught with screenfilling bosses amble amounts of gore and dismemberment and some of the best voiceacting ever heard in a video game gameplay is probably best described as a hacknslash platformer think devil may cry but with more forgiving controls and combos and a much better camera systemive read a few reviews that claim the games are not for gamers and that the difficulty is turned to high i disagree and offer that the games each have multiple selectable difficulty levels both games also offer the player the ability to switch to easy mode at any point in the game without having to start over in easy mode you can rest assured that youll have a leisurely stroll through the gameone area of disappointment that i have with this collection are that the original cg cutscenes havent been redone and in most cases look worse than the actual gameplay its understand given the price of the set but still a bit of a letdown otherwise this is an amazing deal for two of the best ps games ever released also if youre new to the series and are interested in playing god of war i would highly recommend playing gow first as each game is a direct sequel
i played the original force unleashed and overall i thought it was a pretty good game it was nothing great but the story was well done and it kept things moving along i steered away from this one because of the reviews but i finally played it because of the price dropthere are some fun sequences in this game that any star wars fan will like the force powers are fun to use and it is fun to slice through endless waves of storm troopers i thought the final battle in the game was well done toothere are a ton of setbacks this game has to be one of the most repetitive that i have played in a while you use the same set force finishing moves again and again against the same enemies the story is choppy and does not progress well the in game dialogue is terrible and it does not help the flow of things as the other reviewers have noted the game is very shortall in all i would give it a go if you have the time especially since it is at a bargain price it is lucasarts and star wars and there are some things to like i really think lucasarts needs to get back the jedi knight series the x wing series and the battlefront series the force unleashed installments turned to be out more hype and marketing after all was said and done
i have always had both console brands for the exclusives on each i have always liked the xbox better however when this new set of systems came out i decided to go for the one with substantially more to offer and i am very pleased with my choice the xbox delivers on every front and the graphics for the released titles so far are amazing and i like that they kept the controller largely the same the voice controls are actually fun and useful never used them with the previous kinetic whole the xbox on doesnt help anything since you still have to turn on the controller which would turn the console on anyway my favorites are off and record while playing bf and it records the last seconds of gameplay it also does music and movies etc but for this set f consoles i dont really see what the ps has to offer graphics are the same basically both have balancing exclusives and it lacks a lot of the functionality of the xbox one if you are choosing i would recommend this
between the butchered battle system and making the game accessible to the addfps crowd the game is all style and no substancethe story is not intriguing the battle system is tedious and exploration hardly existssave your money because unless all you care about is graphics there isnt much to like hereits funny i used to be this hardcore square fanboy and ive now watched the final fantasy series spiral all the way down the toiletsquareenix was more focused on sales rather than making a good game and it showsi dont understand why it took so long to release this game when there isnt that much to it besides the graphics which are pretty amazing there isnt much to enjoydont eat this tripe thats sold to you as steak
i have grown up with these games i was playing this when i was in fourth grade and had to be watch by my teachers for their belief that i was a psychopath i got this game for my mac i am running on windows boot camp i have to say i was a little saddened still a great story but the controls are annoying you cant save the game and for some reason i am unable to run in the game very odd might be cuz i am not using a real pc this game has not stood well against years of game evolution having said that this is a must play game if you want hitman silent assassin to make more sense and increase enjoyment
story was pretty intense unlike the other gamesmultiplayer is pretty fun and it is still alive usually mid day is when its more full about people lol not much but usually there is or full capacity games that are pretty funthe bad thing about this game is like older call of dutys you cant sprint on story and the xbox version of this game has much much better graphics than the ps but on ps you can actually connect to a game and its extremely hard toi wish this game came out on pc but it did notpick this upeverything after cod is not cod they just carried the name with them to sell products that turned hollywood and make believe crap
the drive itself is fine it works exactly as advertised i like that its really small and attaches right to the unit itself putting it completely out of the waymy sole complaint is the cost relative to the space youre given ninety bucks for a twenty gig harddrive for the same price or less you could find another external hd thats probably triple the capacity or more unfortunately though microsofts hdd is proprietary using a thirdparty isnt an optioni want to illustrate just how small a twenty gig drive actually is as was mentioned before game demos are starting to average about a gig a piece a few of those demos all your game saves a few xbox arcade games and some media content downloads tv shows movies god forbid an hd movie etc those gigs get soaked up a lot faster then you might thinkmicrosoft recently announced that a gig drive will be available soon for twohundred ie its still a lot of money for the space youre given however if you had a core system and were living off of a memory unit for now your best bet is to wait out the bigger drive
i have played this with the wii sports resort it definitely makes your movements more accurate with what happens on the screen but i myself really hate the bulkiness at the end of the wii remote you have to add an attachment to the end of your remote making it a bit heavier and just not as comfortable to hold so i searched for an alternative which happened to be their newest version of the wii remote called the remote where it is a normal sized controller that has motion plus built in already so there is no bulkinessattachment at the bottom of it they are currently selling these remotes on amazon for about or each depending on the color you choose or you can even buy them at places like best buy for about the same price even though it is a higher price to pay i would highly recommend getting this vs the attachment simply for comfort purposes alone its that much better in my book to pay extra for the newest wii remotes what i am doing is keeping my original wii remotes and buying additional wii plus remotes
i was one of those oddballs who gleefully walked past the street fighter machines in search of the bright red neogeo cabinets back in my arcade dayson pure hope i picked this up for my ps i dont have a ps and as luck would have it the game runs exactly as i had hopedas far as the games go well youd have to have a special place in your heart for world heroes to really enjoy this disc the graphics are crude though arcade faithful right up to the neo geo boot screens and although you can access a menu that shows every characters special moves theyre probably going to be a bit confusing to anyone who didnt play this in the arcadethat all said if you ever enjoyed even one of the world heroes games buying this anthology will be money well spent
y enjoying the ps so far i think my biggest gripe are the lack of good games available for it at launch i have been playing the free games with my playstation plus day trial system is nice and small and quite compared to my ps a few gripes i have is the lack of cd playback mp support and dlna support i know those will be coming soon so im not stressing about it quite yet i will rate it five stars once those features are added once games like the new uncharte and a few other ones come out for it then we will appreciate our purchase more in the meantime i am just enjoying it more as a bluray player and streaming device till the content is there i also believe with updates down the road this will improve the way the ps did back in the dayone more side note if when your watching a bluray and you try and get the dtshd master audio and or true hd audio to light up on your receiver you have to change that setting when your in the movie by hitting the options button on the remote and going to audio settings why sony didnt include this in the settings menu is beyond me
ge wars is extreamly fun when buddys of mine come over we play it non stop and play to the death one time we played it for like hours and we still didnt get bored of itits really good with great weapons to choose from it isanother great classic from acclaim the game is no sequali think but it is a must have for any true turok fanif you liked quake youll love this gameits so fun and out of controlthe gameplay is greatthe controls are greatthe weapons are beyond awsomeand the graphics are superb for the time that game came outthe secret characters are what get you to keep playing it causeits so friggin exciting this is a most def if you want to keep this in your collectioni give an a
this is an excellent first person shooter with great graphics story line game play and online multipayer however there are a few things about it that made me a little mad first of all i bought two copies of this game so i could play multiplayer on my pcs then i install the game and patches etc and find out that you can not run two copies of this game even with two cd keys on the same modem that is so bogus i spent a hundred bucks to play two player and i can not do it and why i dont know but their reasoning is flawed anyone who buys two copies of their game should be able to play two player periodsecond during the multiplayer its really annoying to get killed again and again by air power the airstrikes and helis are much too easy to get and bombs are raining everywhere there is no option when you host a server to turn these annoyances off plus there are many many cheap ways to kill people including claymores stun grenades grenade launchers and it seems like its always raining grenades dont get me wrong it is possible to get the and pwn people with say a kill streak but its very difficult with all the cheap ways to kill you on the gameoverall an addictive game with lots of replay value if you play online the one player is fun and i wish the spectre gunship had more than one brief mission very cool
make sure you time yourself with this game hours can pass by quickly ive limited myself to a few turns per sitting i feel that when used this way this game does help build on strategic thinking as well as memory the game is organized in turns which a player delegates cities to build both buildings and units for war the cities can generate income to pay for future expansion and upgrades to buildings enhance your armies or forms of incomethe battles are fun and the graphics are entertaining even in worth the price if youre disciplined enough to only play for a little while
tremendously fun game that reminds me of sort of a combination of the total war strategy games the old darklands crpg and a very good rd person melee combat game in short you can recruit train up and command your own personal army and fight along side them in the struggle for world dominance theres a number of rpg style quests to be found but they can admittedly get a bit repetitive and are somewhat lacking in depth at times in the end though id say the game is mostly about fighting battles to expand the power base of your faction and in this regard the game really does excel
tactics ogre the knight of lodis is one of the best games i have ever playedstory the story is great but i wont spoil it for yousound the sound is great and the music this game has the best soundtrack in any game ever madegameplay the gameplay is great its a stradigyrpg its alot like final fantasy tactics so if you played that game you will love this gamecontrolls the controlls are simple and easyreplay value the replay value is great i have beaten the game at least six times and im still playing the game even todayover all a must have gba gam
i could finished this as soon as i was given it since i started playing it straight away but my boyfriend had other ideas i managed to get to the fifth level i think before this arm came over my shoulder and switched it over the next time i tried to play it could i get past the fat police guy who had a gun nooooooooooo and who are we blaming for that i think i definitely prefer beatemup games or racing but im rubbish at them to any other cos if youre in a seriously bad mood then you get to take all your frustrations out on this i didnt use the special move button much to be honest i forgot about it a lot but it wasnt really necessary as some simple punches were enough to get rid of the bad guys some sure took a little longer but they will eventually diewhat i do find bad with these games is the bad guys rarely change most of them are easy to dispose of and it gets slightly boring when they come at you constantly i hated the guys who looked like chavs ok so you americans arent gon na know that name guys who wear hooded tops hang around street corners think theyre hard just to generalise it with names like jay billy i think they were just too quick to move about for me as i found it really difficult to move up or down as the bad guys normally went the opposite way i did manage to get to the last level of this game but unfortunately got a game over before getting very far i could have finished it on my first try given half a chance though i enjoyed the game squealing every time i killed a bad guy although it does get slightly repetitive and i liked playing as cody he looked good in those jeans
in my opinion this is the best puzzle game out there for the ds i loved the original picross but this takes it to a whole new level i actually completed every single puzzle which took a long long time there are a lot of hours in this game even if you arent good at puzzles once you get the basic idea down of how to narrow down which block to knock out next its the same concept throughout the game players of any level can solve every puzzle as long as you are patient and thorough the price is a steal i would pay fifty dollars for this game easily if you think you want it you do
k i want to love this game i really do it happens to be the most recent hockey game out on any system to my knowledgebut come on only three players on the ice whats up with that you only have access to some of the players not all of them and the way the stats are figured for the players is really bad some of the best players have horrible stats curtis joseph only has a for goalie numbers and hes consistantly one of the best in the league every year the teams are all screwed up too pick a good team and youll get stomped by a real sucky team not cool or realistic if you dont know anything about hockey you might love this gamebut anybody who knows hockey wont like it very muchits worth a rental and maybe to buy if you find it cheapnhl k is a million times better but alas it is out of date and is missing current teams
i havent play neither ico and shadow of colossus on the the ps i just purchased the collection and iam really shocked how intelligent deep and artistic those two games are in fact ico it is the best videogame i have ever played it was an emotional journey to an unbelieveable unreality world and the same time you feel like you are in this castle never a game touched my emotions so gently and deeply as ico this game its difficult to describe and others in other reviews they have already done iti just want to say if havent play these games buy the collection now its a very special game shadow of colossus is also a very wellcrafted game with fantastic enviromens and very interesting gameplay i enjoyed it very much but i fell in love with ico so i want to focus thereanyway team ico is the best iam so impatient for their new game last you very much mr fumito ueda for making so different emotional and intelligent games
fter first seeing what sony would be offering in their new handheld gaming device called the ngp at that time i was totally stoked i purchased the miniature console with several games and less than a year later i sold it all off the problem with the vita to me became apparent sony has created this incredible hardware albeit expensive at the time and for more than months never treated it like it deserved the design was beautiful the oled screen really made games and hd videos look crisp and clear and unlike its predecessor the psp it had real miniature analog sticks something that had been long since criticized on the psp adding the rear touchpad gave it another cool new feature that could be used for anything the studios dreamed up this concept was also implemented on the playstation controllerthe ps vitas interface is almost identical to the playstation unlike the psp which used now obsolete umds universal media disc the vita uses little game cards instead now that the ps has been released one of the things sony has started to do right has been to implement the use of the vita with the playstation in cross play and remote play situations what this means is that i could be playing a game on my vita in one room while my playstation is running in another this is something of a draw for me and may convince me to go back and purchase another vita however i still find it a bit irritating that there are not enough triple a titles for this incredible little machine
this game have many improvements over phantom hourglass like better graphics better and bigger soundtrack more challenging puzzles some of them may be too hard for kids epic boss battles and more weapons but something makes me not like this game as much as its predecessorthe great flaw in this version is the replay value i have finished phantom hourglass times while i couldnt play this game again not even once in this game you have to travel to many places using a train the train is a bit slow and sometimes the long train travels becomes unbearable tedious and boring thats the reason i coulnt play it anymore after i finished the main storyin my opinion phantom hourglass is better overall
the original age of kings was a great game perhaps it was a bit too favorable to two of the civs ahem teutons and franks but the campaigns were still a blast the conquerors isnt so much an expansion pack as a complete overhaul of the game the civs have been radically balanced especially with the patch available on ensembles website new civs have been added and a ridculous amount of new random maps are now available i also suspect that the enemy ai has been greatly honed but i cant really prove it all i know is that theyre still pretty darned tough on moderate for random maps campaigns no longer have the same five level difficulty systemif you already have age of kings this is definitely worth the investment now that both have been bundled with the original age of empires however you might want to shell out the money for the deluxe pack aoe is a much simpler game but still worthwhile every night i hope that aoe iii will be as good as the conquerers what i consider to be the peak of the aoe universe
this has the best megaman x games out there im a big fan of xxx and x the menusfeatures arent great and are lacking but its the games that are important all of the games work just as well as the originals and i feel they work best on the ps controller over the other consoles all of the games are untouched letting the experience be as it was when they came out it even has the psone version of x with better quality music which is a big bonus since x is incredibly rare and expensive alonethis has every game in the series up to x the quality of the games are mostly high though thats mostly up to personal taste i honestly didnt care for x or x but the rest of the games are topnotch platforming with some of the best soundtracks in the genrethere are some forgettable extras a few bits of concept art music nothing you cant find online honestly the reason to get this is strictly the games which are worth itthe one big gripe i have with this collection is if you play it on ps through an component it will not work the games will not display though the menus will im not sure why this is since ive played sonic mega collection on the same set up and ive had no problemsthe collection does work on compatible pss via hdmi theres very slight controller delay which can be hard to take in a d platformer however this can vary as i understand between monitors set upshowever with that problem its still a solid collection as a lot of these games are hard to get and they are emulated really really well
this game would be great if it were playable when pressing r to open chests it acts like it isnt being held the double jump doesnt work i initially thought it was my controller tried another same result and looked online a plethora of people are having this issue playstation had no answers when i called they said that the number to contact god of war iii was their number but it wasnt anything they had a solution to ridiculous and disapointing i recommend against buying this until that is fixedlatest patch has fixed my glitch i still drop a star due to this initial problem combined with it being not as good as uncharted in my opinion
ften a sequel is lacking in imagination and just rehashes the same old stuff mass effect was a nice surprise although i thought itwas a little too difficult for an gamer like myself i still managed to play through to the end and enjoyed the game immensely thestory line was fresh and the graphics were out of this world humans and aliens both looked so life like you could truly immerse yourselfinto the game the video sequences were nicely done and of course the music was top notch i didnt notice any bugs in the game and thisis truly refreshing for an of the game dont forget that the mass effect series of games is more of a shooter type game withrpg elements i think i said in my review of the original that if you are looking for just an rpg you will be disappointed and if you arelooking for just a shooter you will be disappointed if you play me with an open mind and immerse yourself in the amazing dialogue withyour crew i think you will be pleased with the game oh and for the most part the voice acting was superb
i love this game my friend had it at her house so i played it with her and never really bought it but recently i remembered it and thought of how fun the gameplay and puzzles were so i ordered it and i do not regret it i loved the way they story just continues from where the first one left off i played the first one on my pc while i was waiting for this to come in the mail theres a character names glados and her little comments kind of make you start giggling in the middle of the game i was playing the game and heard her make fun of your character and i just started laughing really hard the gameplay mechanics were simple on the xbox but the puzzles can be very challenging once i finished a puzzle it left me feeling really bright and happy and then theres the load screen the load times were very long so you just might want to try installing the game which should help that a bit anyway the game was one of the best i picked up in a long time
there somethings you can always count on and one of them is that rocksteady studios knows how to make a great batman game batman arkham city is one of thee best single player games that i have ever had played this game is so amazing that if theres any award show that doent give this game at least four awards ill never watch that award show again as long as i livearkham city improves on its predecessor in so many ways the open worldthe boss battles the gadgets the enemie ai i can go on and onbatman arkham asylum does so much to make the experience as playing batman fun you have to think like batman use shealth and smart tactics while fighting enemiesthe game is going to get challenging i assure you but it will only make the victories more rewarding the sound is another astounding feature in this game you can hear enemies engaging in full on elaborate conversations about there problems and there worriesbatman the music the fits this game perfectly its stay true to the old batman movies and the new ones mark hamill and kevin convoy also reprises there role the graphics in arkham city are close to perfect the filmnoir look of everything is true eye candywith beautiful lighting effectsanimations and a lavishing open world arkham cityone impressive new feature is side missions this is the first game i played in awhile where the side missions are nearly better the main missions theres a all star cast of villians in arkham city thatll make appearance in most of the side missions so upon completing the main story the side missions will definitely keep you busy to more hoursthe dark knight returns and does away with problems that plauge the arkham asylum repeative boss battles and no side missions batman arkham city is everthing a single player game should be engrossing and full of variety if you miss out on arkham city you will miss out on the greatest gaming experiences ever realized
i bit the bullet and bought this game and its not as bad as anyone is saying it is and i mean cmon are you compairing it to big budget realeases or something ive played for a bit and seen none of the glitches or floating bodies that ign have complained about and while the graphics are not all that great they sure as hell aint crappy the game does feel a bit awkward to play but i think its because this is a great concept that nobody has tried before and because of the reviews this has gotten we probably wont see a sequal which would have tidied up the gamplay and polished the game up a bit i have enjoyed this so far what i dont like is people saying its from codemasters and they suck so this was doomed from the get hello people griddirtoverlordfuel anyone its a alright attempt at something fresh i give them a a for effort but a c in execution not great not bad not worth but maybe worth
this game is fun enough but if you own and like the regular game you should not buy this game as a separate disk here it is the same dlc downloadable content you can get with the regular game the reason you should buy it as dlc through the regular read dead redemption game instead is that when your playing multiplayer both rdr and undead free roam maps are the same in fact you can probably see players from both games in the free roam and other modes but there are mini games within the free roam multiplayer mode where it says you have to have the undead pack to play so this is stupid changing disks every time you want to play different mini games on the same map if you get all this good gaming content as dlc you will have access to all of the map on free roam and play undead stuff mixed with regular stuff so i suggest this game only for people that want to play this game only and not the regular game too so yes this is a good game but buy it as dlc insteadred dead redemption

yes doom was the beginning of the fps genre as we know it but halflife marked the beginning of an evolutionary leap for the genre quite simply put halflife is and will remain one of the greatest games ever i really cant put the gameplay experience into words but i remember when i first played this game almost ten years ago i was absolutely absorbed seriously absorbed at the time the mods were sharp fun and novel counterstrike firearms team fortress classicman those were fun daysif you havent played this game you need to experience it and understand what it has done to the world of firstperson shooters the enemies the weapons the music the levels the creativity its a cinematic experience in itself and youre the star
this game obviously isnt a finished product its full of glitches and bugs it is hardly worth more then et for the atari it isnt worth it even if you want a time wasting game its supposed to be a racing game but it isnt your opponent doesnt even move there is a fixer that you can download but even then you always win and when you do you get greeted by a delightful youre winner you can easily move off track and nobody would care you can fly through nothing this game has no barriers you can even pass through everything including bridges you can even run thousands of miles in a circle and stop in a microsecondif you want to get the game for a laugh buy it but buy it somewhere else its overpriced on amazon
i got this yesterday and played for hours straight without noticing time passing funny because it is about time travel there are so far no repeat puzzles and they are challenging i love the story line of luke and the professor traveling to the future the animation is the best yet there are a lot more scenes where luke and the professort talk just like a video and some of the scenes are like a movie of real londonif you like games that challenge your brain and have a story line to follow this it is i mastered the first edition and i am almost done with the diabolical box one but seem to be stuck in a loop on the train you still search for hidden coins and talk to people you will recognize from former games there are puzzles and at the end you can unlock hidden content more games just like the last twolove it professor layton fans dont miss this one it is truly the best
i love this game you play a top yakuza in the midst of a crime and mystery in japan i wont give details away but it is very storyoriented with some action inbetween you can fight with your hands or you can buy weapons but they have a limited number of uses im not very good at fighting games but this wasnt too difficult for me some fights are challenging depending on the person youre against particularly majima and the champion in purgatory you also have some free reign to explore find items and clues gamble and finish sidemissions this lets you earn exp for leveling skills and money to buy whatever you want you can also visit host bars and try to win different girls but they waste your money eating gives you exp and restores your health i havent finished the game yet but it is extremely addicting i played this for hours the first time i started until i couldnt stay awake anymore makes me wish i owned a ps to play yakuza

creepytwisted game but not as much fun as sh homecoming imo game looks and plays great but focuses too much on side quest needed more enemy variety about fourmaybe fiveenemies repeated over and over final boss was very cool and fun to fight the of sequences got boring and tedious if you are a fan of survival horror games then give it a tryits worth the current list price if new to the silent hill series then start with an older title silent hill homecoming had a more creepy feel to it and is the better game for current consoles im just saying
this was a christmas must have that flopped in a big way basically the shooter inplaygroundis more exciting this game tries to emulate a more mature game by having a story line but it is little more than a gallery of small shooting games it starts out amazingly with a corridor that you walk down shooting at targets gets a mom a for lack of violence it is slightly reminiscent of doom a fave of mine as a kiddo however the developers of this game seem to just give it a nod and then move on to a series of repetitive mini games that are more or less the same just more targets in each round the problem is that the targets are very far away detracting from the fun aiming my son the intended gift recipient is not even impressed with the shot gun as a toy and would much rather have nerf nstrike vulcan ebf blaster yellow which will run you less than forty macaroons at the store with the red circles have no fear for your digitalready tv the clip that holds real nerf bullets pulls out to insert your wiimote thus there are no actual nerf bullets anywhere near the playing of the wii game this game was slightly more interesting for me the mama holding my attention for about an hour its just average there are much much much better games out there
cool boarders was one of the first games i bought for my ps and i loved it when i got a ps i got this game for a nextgen snowboarder and it blew me away the graphics on this are mindblowing and the tracks are so complex that it never gets old you can keep racing a track several times then suddenly notice this little break in some trees that you take and shave a minute off your time and puts you in first place another thing about this is the fact that your opponents will actually fall from time to time when trying difficult stunts so you always stand a chance if you dont keep falling down that makes the game a challenge but fun too i have to say this is a game that has such replayability that youll be reaching for it whenever you have the time to play i especially love the free ride option where you can just go down the course trying to find shortcuts and other secrets grab it and go
this game is one of the best in the series it has all of the amazing intense buildup from resident evil and all of the awesome coop action from resident evil my boyfriend and i bonded over our love of killing zombies and im so glad that zombies are back we both loved resident evil but we definitely missed the slow paced dread that hordes of zombies can fill you with and this game has both though we both still wish that resident evil would be rereleased with coop action we will gladly take this game instead any resident evil fan knows what im talking aboutcant wait to play and replay the heck out of this game i anticipate at least months of gameplay especially since there are three campaigns with two characters per campaign as well as the mercenaries feature
so this is a star game for me the story is good i have not read the books but i suspect it is solely created for the game to fill in the holes it is well done the story kept me playing for hours and i must say i was pretty enticed to the plot as for the game play its not class one material and definitely will not make avid game fans like me satisfied the gameplay is simple and unexciting you dont care much about your armor and weapons except for their looks some of the fights are pretty repetitive the dialogue options and game setup are great though i recommend this game to got series fans if you liked the tv you probably will love the game oh make sure you are sort of a gamer to at least enjoy a bit of gameplay or you might just want to read the story or watch the playthrough from a websiteps the art book is a plus
ttt is an awesome gamethere are lots of characters to unlock a bowling minigame and morethe beauty of this game is its complexity tekkens fighting system is not easy to master there are reverals and even reversals of reversals called chickens buttton smashing will not do in ttt instead you gain insight with several of the characters and become better and better there are difficulty levels to choose from and learn with there is a practice mode to practice combos and moves you can play players and the tag mode is decentthe graphics are topnotch the sound is awesome the characters are wellbalanced and different fighting system is complex and therere lots of replayability what more can you ask for
this is a great system for kids or mariosims fans i only play manhunt on it as it is the only game i was interested in for the wii i bought it for my wife and child i use the xbox which has way better and more numberous amounts of games and amazing graphics the graphics are very gamecubish which is not overly impressive after playing a and the controls get annoying after awhile but its still a good system that plays the old game cube games and stuff i have yet to see a game on this system that is up to snuff on the graphics though its like game cube thin edition
ware words fail me again they have made a quality title beyond imagination creative beyond a shadow of a doubt of people agree that banjokazooie is a landmark title with everything the n has to offer and that it is worthy of out of stars while developed early in ns lifespan the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released the sound is equally as impressive for n and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed depending on your situationi am proud to say many people love this game many of my friends still play it occasionally however few have beaten it all the way this game is solid for hours of gaming but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note and every other item some people dislike it and do not be fooled a year male old who listens to ultrahard rock and loves games with extreme violence andor nudity will not like this game it is by no means for everybody many gamers from preschool to high school will like it but not everybodythe controls are easy enough to master and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice the sound is superb the graphics are good for an n title there is not a dull moment in this game and the attention to detail is amazing the puzzles the meat of the game are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids the puzzle peices your reward for completeing a puzzle are well hidden the musical notes the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld are challenging to find the most fun part of the game visiting mumbo is quite enjoyable he transforms you into various forms a fat walrus a termite and even a bumble bee there isnt really an advancing story but thats okay you get an occasional cinematic but its pretty basicthe story goesthe evil witch gruntilda is happily hanging out atop her mountain when the tootie sister of banjo the bear strolls by overcome with jealousy she sees tootie is quite a bit than her so she kidnapps banjos sister and creates a machine to suck tooties out and put it into her banjo and his sidekick breegull kazooie set off to find tootie a mole named bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the gamewell i hope you enjoy this game thanks for reading this review and until next
since getting a playstation ive been waiting for a game with a largescale city with civilians that react to me and my presence i just didnt think id have to forfet gamepalya nd overal fun to get it assasins creed does give me gorgeous openended cities with all the skyscraping towers an acrobatic badass could ever want but besides that theres nothing although i wanted a responsive city i was hoping for a little more than platoons of bareknuckle brawling lunitics and inyourface beggars that will constintly blow your cover in the same recycled missionsthe only motive that compelled me to play was the historicalhitman storyline with a st century perspective that lines itself up right for the inevitable sequal cutscenes are freemoving with alternating camera angle options that where an obivious nod to halflife giving the protagonist altiar anikin skywalker characteristics made me feel like i was truly a medevil jedi especialy in the countercombat animations which were totally sick even if the control scheme was a total button masher
this game doesnt compare much with previous final fantasies i didnt play the problem with this game is that the characters are just flat out uninteresting ive been playing for hours now and i can only remember a few of their names i dont care about any of them i dont even really know what the story is about it gets really confusing lord of the rings style with all the long bizarre names cloud was a simple name zell vivi yuna i can spell those i cant even pronounce the names of a lot of people and places in this game which makes me forget about them also some characters look the same and theyre dressed boringly and have no personalityon the plus side graphics sound and control couldnt be better
this is the most original game that has come out sincesinceuhhhchrono trigger the battle system is great i like the combo deal and the graphics are nice they include paralaxxing side scrolling and nice prerendered backgrounds the spritebased character models are animated very nicely and they have loads of detail the music is very nice it is one of my favorite features i like the whole idea of training warriors then sending them upvery fascinating i am also a fan of norse mythology so its all the more better nice story and nice character development i mean great character development dungeons are very fun i know this review didnt make much sense but oh well
this game as many people said is a little disappointing i wish they had waited a bit longerstorythe story has the same gameplay as storm instead of which let you use jutsu and tree jumping but i guess it isnt needed the story starts from where they left off and goes up to the final battles of the war the end is only messed up because they wanted to end peaceful and since the manga isnt done with the war there is no way to end it peaceful which is why i wish they waited or ended with a to be continued the kages beating madara is annoying when he left them half dead and kabuto vs itachi and sasuke wasnt there naruto was with kakashi and guy so i dont know how theyll make storm because they cant pick up where they left off quick time events werent as good as in storm and gameplay best in storm like wall fighting and clashing so storm is for having all updated characters hero and legend is not much of a difference since legend is pretty easyonlinethey took away replays from generation and added more ninja info cards thats all spammers still use masked man madara nagato sasuke naruto and all the op charactersgameplaythey kept the instant dash which is good and bad supports help a lot more which is great and can be called by holding b or o ringouts are not needed but they rarely happen so i dont see it bothing you if you dont mind seeing big cracks in the air instant awakening should be a second option like there should be a choice to use that or the cinematic they lower you chakra bar and can be annoying some have second and third jutsus when awakened like lee have hidden lotus or third hokage having mud wall only combos are brought back and dumbed down a bit which i hate all the waycharactersthey say over characters but many are just filled spots like chojithere are about new characters since generations covers most of them plus a few more dlc is coming out but only for costumes for the main character like lederhosen naruto or student sasuke jugo is still in pajamas and karin is still uselessoverall storm has good points and bad so if you want to upgrade from generations only if you love naruto or buy whatever they make this isnt as good as storm was but is still good for those who skipped generations i am disappointed a bit but i not ungrateful enough to bitch about it
i bought this thinking it was a party game not a party game i thought the skill ball would be fun its not if your hand tilt right the ball goes left and viceversa there is nothing to really keep you this game except trying to find a better game to playand there just arent any there really is nothing worth mentioning except save your money the game play is weak the characters are mostly slight variations of a small number of different characters and it just isnt fun or captivating i read that the quarters game was fun if you were drinking well perhaps but who wants to drink that much just to enjoy a video game enough said if you buy it told you is all i can say
bejeweled twist was my most awaited game release since i was gifted with a nintendo lite this past christmas i have bejeweled deluxe that has been well played and worth the games price when the bejeweled twist ds arrived i dove into playing it the game definitely has a learning curve with the feature the time bombs and the locked gems but picking up on how to place this game was not so hard or time consuming that causes frustration or saying no why did i buy this game once you catch on time passes by so fast that if you are just passing time you need to keep one eye on the game and one eye on time occasionallyits a very relaxing game if i have some chill time or if i turn in for the night early i find myself often playing this game for an hour or so the only time i personally probably would not play the game is places where one waits a short period of time like for a doctors or dental appointment during those times i would revert to one of my other games simply because i think the game does need attention and isnt just mindlessly killing a short period of timei think its the best of both worlds for me as a bejewled fan i can play the deluxe game on my computer or the twist game on my nintendo this game of bejeweled has certainly evolved from its first conceptionvery much for the better with each new version i cant say enough about this game
i bought this game originally for myself but my stepdaughter loves the graphics and the music and the characters as with most rpgs the gameplay is slowpaced so she can actually play this game from exploring all the gorgeous and lively locales to engaging the party in battles to following the map to the next destination my yr old can do most of it allwe also take turns reading the dialogue between all the imaginative characters so this helps with her reading skillsbut if you dont have kids do not be put off by this review this is still a fantastic rpg by any of the highest rpg standards great storylinethat makes sense and you are interested in seeing it to the end not overly complicated battles or controlssome diehard rpgers may actually be upset by this fantastical graphics characters and environmentsmy stepdaughter wasnt at all interested in final fantasy x mostly because i think the graphics were too good suikoden graphics are great the characters have a cartoony fun feel to themwhich is a good thing length of game will be good i think iwe are almost hours into it and weve only completed the chapter s of the main characters we are close to completing the chapter of a secondary character but it looks to be a long haul to finish because my party of is too weak to take on the giant boar that we must defeat random battleswandering monsters is not annoying as they do not happen constantly and the way the fighting system is set up you can usually go to auto to slay quickly i think we will be playing this for quite some time to come and iwe look forward to finding and meeting as many of the stars of destiny as we canin almost hours of gameplay weve only recruitedfound one so farwhy is this game already unavailable on amazon i grew bored with ffx quickly and wasnt at all hooked by wild arms but suikoden iii snagged me hook line and sinker from the beginningim not an anime fan at all but the opening collage of very well done anime of characters from the game along with haunting and lovely japanese jpop is simply great
the game has great potential side quests a little too easynot much story linebut its fallout the biggest hurdlebethesda needs to clear is to fix these bugs three times i have been to level at which time it decides to stop workingi can explore till my feet fall offbut confront anythingand it freezes i finally decided to leave my twocompanions behindthis alowed me to play for minutes before it froze it is great that a company meets its deadlinefor getting the product they promised outbut at what cost let us debug it at this point tictactoe is more enjoyableat least there is an end to it
i have the kinect and wondered how good this was so i purchased it with sports champions and one move controller after many sessions to me its almost the same as kinect they both arent that accurate but it was an okay experience my only complaint about this is the requirement of the silly looking move controller love the light up colors for some games you will find you need more than one move controller like archery volleyball etc its optional but in the long run will benefit you better its simple to setup just plug in the usb to your ps and thats it no power cordusb combo like kinect in my opinion the catalog of games for playstation move is weak resistance house of the dead time crisis little big planet franchise and sports champions stand out the mostseems like with most games like sports champion you dont really have to be as active like kinect i guess thats a plus if you dont want to move around a lot i feel this is where the accuracy gets hurt because in situations where you have to dodge or jump you dont really have to as you would with a kinect feels like a rip off but whateverin my opinion kinect is better no extra accessories are needed playing a shooting game is understandable but as i stated earlier even kinect is not that accurate either sadly the ps eye doesnt take commands like kinect that would of been nice addition but oh well my final thought on this product is its definitely not something you really really need but is okay to have personally i would play kinect more
this game is extremely fun there are a lot of characters to choose from not as many as smackdown just bring it or raw is war for xbox but still there are a lot the finishing moves are great but the only problem is two things one it is way to easy to perform a finishing move you can be about inches away fromthe guy and still perform it it is way to easy to build up your little quotbarquot in order to perform a finishing move and three triple h does not do a figure leg lock and five when he does it his leg is going through the other guys leg come on no wonder its rated teen for quotcartoon violencequotover and all this game is pretty fun but no where as good graphics game play and movement as just bring it or raw is war for xbox which is the best oh and for those people who look more aobut me ignore the review about raw crashing i got it fixed and now it works perfectly
im pleased with this version of forza i dont get into the painting and decorating of the cars i couldnt care less about that part of the game im not a car expert so i only do limited tuning although i may try a bit harder after getting through the single player season modethe season mode offers up races based on your prior race preferences and cars in your garage it makes it so you dont need to try to find races you qualify for im a decent racer but not great for sure and have found the season mode a bit easy after seasons i have most of the assists turned off and the ai on medium my guess is that cranking up the ai skill would provide a challenge to more skilled players one thing i dont like about the events is that it doesnt give you a track map before hand so you cant easily see how you might want to tweak your car the cars feel different and believable when driving them i visuals are excellent and make the racing more enjoyablei focus on single player only as there are too many brats online but people have been complaining on the forums that the match making for races isnt as good as forza i think any racing fan can enjoy this game there are plenty of driving assists so beginners to this type of game can be competitive but also dialed up as you get better
this is pretty fun who didnt in the pool when you were a little kid pretend to be a shark and eat your parents or friends or when you were older and at the beach and some hot girl you liked is facing the shore swim under them and bring your hands with your fingernails together on their leg so for a brief second they think theyre being attacked by a shark well now you get to be that shark all over again the aim of this game is that basically youre an eating machine and if you dont keep eating words will flash on the screen telling you that youre starving and if you dont eat someone or something soon youll eventually die you can also die or come close to it by being eaten by other sharks eating poisonous creatures getting stung by jellyfish or swimming too deep and staying down there too long there is tasty stuff to find down there though the screen graphics are pretty good not photographic realistic but a far cry above what you think of with the words computer game animation its quite fun when you eat someone on a boat ramp or a woman that reminds me of the naked girl at the start of jaws shes got a bikini on in this game your victims may cool terrified sound effectshungry shark evolution isnt an adrenaline game or fast moving action game its a relaxing way to pass the time it may well be too slow for those who get bored easily the better you do the bigger species of shark you can become im still on the initial shark but hes cool a lot of these apps you play once and then delete from your device ill definitely be keeping this one to play from time to time it really is a relaxing game update after trying a few other games what i never realised was a real bonus at the time i first played it with hungry sharks evolution is that you can play the game without being connected to wifi so you can play it in bed on a plane or whenever you want without needing to be in a library cafeacute or somewhere with wifi i dont understand why so many other games with less content than this one force you to be online just to play them
in the great year known as where lots of great games were releasedkingdom hearts topped the list with good gameplaybeautiful and accurate graphicsstunning voiceovers and great battle sequences top that off with a very good storyline and youve got one killer of a gamesoradonald and goofy are on a quest to find soras friendsas well as king mickeywhile vanquishing the heartlessbeings that haunt sora continouslyand disney villans as well in addition to his friendssora also has the mighty keyblade to assist him in battlethe whole game is just pure genious the worlds stay true to the disney filmswellexcept for maybe wonderland and the music is probably some of the best score to come out of any video game in quite a whileone purchase you will not regret i suggest it to any final fantasy fan
first off this game is good second amazon has it for the cheapest price brand newf you have a wii u this game will be great for your collectionand dont worry about missing the story from the other games if you have not played them they have a minute comic book cutscene in the beginning that explains everything and gives you options to choose from that does affect the game between the touch map and wii u controls this game is very decentit has the free dlc ending and one other built in dlc but for the price you cant go wrong with this version if your thinking about getting it go ahead its well worth it
this is atari greatness at its best like someone said dont pass this by these are the glory dayz of gaming they are forever alive within me for they are the only things i have left after the air force was done screwing my life all i have are my precious vidoe games with their immortal character such as the unforgettables as link mario luigi princess toadstool princess zelda toad samus yuri from breath of fire and nina my dark angel also from breath of fire they will never be lost to me and will never leave me long live video games for all eternity
first let me say that there are really great aspects to this game visually this game blows me away at times i have found myself doing nothing but walking around the world taking in all the sights that is where my true fascination with this game ends though and had it not been for the stunningly beautiful world i wouldve rated this game loweri am trying to figure out why people have been so captivated by this game the story line or perhaps the pace of it is literally mindnumbingly boring i bought this game when it first came out i played it for probably hours hoping that it would eventually get interesting it didnt so i stopped playing it sometime after that i was desperate for a good rpg and started doing some readingresearch online for a good game i ran into a review of this game and in the article they cautioned that the game was so huge it was easy to completely lose track of the main story keeping this in mind i started playing the game again this time focusing on the main story after another to hours of playing with the focus on the main story i am still so bored that i dont think i will ever be able to finish this gamethe lack of a great story is the true downfall of this game i have read where people herald things such as the realism of it turning night and day perhaps i am in the minority here but this doesnt add one ounce of enjoyment to my gaming experience personally i found this to be quite annoying many times after heading into town to do some trading because i needed money and was the shops would be closed then you need to find something to do without venturing out too far because the shops might be closed again by the time you get back to kill time all night until they open again soooooo boring i love being able to roam freely but i have played and replayed linear games with an awesome story that i couldnt put down it is always easy to critize but i think if the developer had focused more on the depth of the story instead of the depth in of the world this could have been a truly great game as it stands now though it is barely ok however i would probably still spend the just to see the level of depth they put into the world as it is pretty amazing
if you like bmovies that are so bad theyre good you might like the story mode which kinda feels like a twistaplot book where you get to see things from different aspects depending which character you select st i pretty much solved the story modes it landed on my shelfat really only characters it just doesnt have much depth no tag mode no cage ladder match etc makes it feel like a very inferior wwe game once you get tired of looking at the girls which doesnt take longi personally hate the vow system because you can only use persona at a time unlike later wwe games where you can pick to fight as a face or a heel before starting every match so you can match hollywood hogans outfit with him as a heel or have classic hogan fight as a face without having to go in change him over stsince you can basically buy it for a rental price now id say go ahead buy it though you can then take your time maybe not get tired of it as fast plus its there if you ever feel the itch again
ive been a big fan of the aw series since the beginning on the gba and i couldnt not have been happier with dual strike the replay value of this game is incredible and i cant put it down tons of new cos and tag team battles the ability to level up cos and great multiplayer some of the nd screen implementation is a little rough but its still enjoyable and there could have been more useful new vehicles the stealth fighter and aircraft carrier and pretty lame in my opinion still with so many modes to play in you just cant go wrong i purchased a ds just for this series and i am certainly glad i did
those of us who play nancy drew all the time know that the basic interface doesnt change much but the actual games do some are too short others are just not so enjoyable this one was one of the better ones in my opinionas usual there is the makework aspect you have to work at the snack bar and it does get tiresome but it wasnt too bad sort of like life you do your chores and then you get to go have some fun the puzzles and games are fun and thats partly why i play the nancy drews
i got the deathadder sort of reluctantly but am so pleased with its feel and performance i previously owned a habu and a g g and mx before those the deathadder is clearly the best mouse out of all of them the g optical sensor is extremely good at tracking all movement while not being overly sensitive and does not create any erratic movement issues its movement is so precise and yet has a certain softness to it very much unlike the habu which was too sensitive and the movement had a harshness to it the drivers loaded without a hitch the firmware was actually the most recent version so installation was a breeze very unusual for razer but a welcome change for sureat any rate physically the deathadder is fairly light about the same weight of an mx maybe even a smidge lighter its a perfect weight for my liking the chord is very flexible and doesnt pull back on the mouse when you let go thank goodness its the same overall as being chordless but with the chord the shape of the da is roughly the same as the habu very similar to the intellimouse explorer but with an updated body kit which makes it slip into the had more naturally the button valleys are more pronounced than just about any mouse i have used in a while which i like my fingers come to rest right in the center of the buttons the rounded cresttop of the mouse is fairly tall sort of like an arch support for the hand the wheel roll and click are both have a perfect amount of resistance very easy to rollclick but not too easy clearly a lot of thought and dare i say love went into the creation of this mouse
first of all id like to askwhats the deal with eair lines penuts i mean there there but you cant open the bag who are they trying to keep out of these things seriously i dont get on plaines alot but the penuts are always there and they wont openoh anyways i recomend this game since when it first came out it was the talk of the town or country every body i know either bought it or kept renting it till they beat the game but even after that they still played for hours then i bought it and i couldnt stop playing it i did everything i could do in the game and when i say everything i mean airline penutuhhh everything but i still play it and then i bought a new game but yet i still play wind waker for hours and hours to come and goi would like to thank the creators of wind waker and hope real badly that theyd make another zelda game cause so far i have all the zelda games that ever came out and i know everything about all of them too i could tell you that the very second zelda ever created was the worst and i know people that agree too but all the other zelda games are worth buying or renting and i know alot of people would just read the reviews that are short but i have to sayzelda is the best
i bought this on amazon knowing it said to have at least windows xp or but hoping it would work with vista anyway after reading another review that seemed to suggest it could be done i just want to let other customers know that it does not work with vista i uploaded all cds to my computer and it was after i had done so that my computer told me there were known compatibility issues with using that software on vista so i never got to play the game and do not know how it is but will be looking to sell my game i will wait til upgrading to windows and perhaps sims will offer a windows version sometime in future
this is one of the first games ive played on the ps i got this last year along with the god of war collection and uncharted and this game beats the rest of the rpgs on the ps theres a high replay value since theres so many different class systems spells abilities and items to play around with ive easily logged in over hours on this game the battle systems take getting used to but is fantastic after you get acclimated the boss fights are challenging and require strategy and itemcharacter matching one playthrough would take you hours depending on how many sidequests you undertakesome cons are that with the new ps firmware update after may the game freezes a lot more but bioware is working to fix that bug another con might be the lag of graphics during high processed fights and skirmishes but the ps handles this game well and its a really fun experiencei would recommend buying this game new as you get codes for dlc with the game like the golem character and blood dragonplate armor otherwise they would be and respectively theres also tons of other dlc for this including the soso expansion to keep you busy for hours on end the expansion is a rent but ive played every dlc and expansion for this game including the wardens keep and return to ostagar and ive loved them all make sure you buy wardens keep as well because it gives you a infinite storage chest great characters great story and awesome game
never have played naught but noticing a couple glowing praises from highly respected reviewers when i came to see what the faotd was i excitedly downloaded naught what wonderful silhouette art what pleasing background music what no actual settings options beyond languages a gravity platformer that requires the manipulation of the world orientation in order to move even changing the ceiling into the ground naught promises to be a lot of fun with those with far smaller tablets than i samsung tab alas with a screen the tilt accelerometer control is awkward at best and the sensitivity of the touchscreen control option frustrated me to no end yes if there was a setting to reduce sensitivity for the touchscreen id be ecstatic over this beautifully designed game but as is i sadly must relegate naught as not too playable for me
no single player campaignwhat does this mean for the average player theres no campaign to start or finishmeaning you could just play the game for five minutes and put it aside because theres nothing to dooh theres a which basically teaches you how to play the game but it statesat the start of the gauntlet that its not part of the soul calibur storyits like saying this game doesnt matter you have kratos the game looks good you have multiple characters and you can create characters of your owncons you have kratos who has no story at all hes just shown up and will hang aroundone of the most interesting story driven characters in gaming justs exists in this gameand fights people in quick matches you have multiple characters and nothing to do with themjust quick matches thats allconsidering how much effort clearly went into the game how hard would it have been to adda movie for each character which you see after beating random characters
this is truly a portable game system so small that it will fit in your hand the gbmicro is worth the money especially now that its price has gone down it is comfortable the buttons have this great to them when pressed the screen is ultrasharp and bright bright as a ds lite the battery life in phenomenal and only takes about an hour to an hour and a half to charge the start and select buttons light up blue at start up to show the micro still has a good charge then turn red when charging is needed people have complained that the micro does not feature backwardscompatibility with game boy and game boy color games but having those larger carts sticking out of your tiny micro would kind of defeat its purpose no i absoulutely love this thing it is always in my pocket while the ds lite is the king right now the gbmicro is perfect for everyone hardcore and casual gamers you will find that it is deffinitely more travelfriendly i highly recommend it to collectors get one now
this game is the best racing game i have played i really liked gt and even but this game along with its predecessor are better in a lot of ways even if you are not an experienced player when it comes to racing games you will catch on quit the game allows you to learn at your own pace witch in the end makes it more fun for everyone the customizing and upgrading have improved from the first game it really is a challenge for experienced players and a breeze for newbies both at the same time but if you like racing games any at all then buy this you wont be disappointed
so i havent liked a gta game since vice city theyve all felt the same and after red dead redemption which was basically gta with horses i had enough of rockstar but last year when my ps broke down on me i needed to pick up a new one when i went to the store they had different pss for sale gig ps by itself and gig ps with gta packaged inside it so i picked that one up and never touched gta for a long time figuring it was gon na be just like all the rest so why bother but after a long time of it sitting on my shelf i found myself bored one night and figure id see what changes were made to the series i am really glad i did this game is unbelievably good they literally changed everything i couldnt stand about the gta series on the whole this game has a very solid feel to it the graphics are amazing the voice acting is very solid and the music selection is great ive already beaten the game and am just going around looking for small crap to do because im not ready to stop playing its coming out for the ps at the end of this year and i plan on picking it up on there just so i can play it all again id say grab it if your on the fence
i played a few of the old silent hill games but they never really did much for me they always seemed to be not quite as good as whatever version of re was out at the same time so i went with re for my survival horror fix plus they always seemed to be gory for the sake of being gory which is pointless and dumbthis game however is different i wouldnt even call this a survival horror game if you hadnt told me it was a silent hill game i would have never come to that conclusion on my own its dungeon crawlerhack and slashold school action rpg goodness its just deep enough to keep you interested simple and quick enough for pick up and play and long enough to make your purchase worthwhileonly reason it doesnt get stars is that while im about levels in so far i imagine it will get a little repetitive after a whilethe did the proper thing with a mobile game they took concepts of the original series and put them into a format that translates well to a handheldi would call this the best rpg for the vita so farwith all of the a titles coming out this month and next for vita i hope this one doesnt get missed
sonic the hedgehog used to be a huge hit for the sega system now that sega isnt a competitor any more the gamecube has picked up this star and expanded its gameplayfirst for normal gameplay you now get to choose from a good or bad team instead of just one character each team is made up of individual characters you can be the sonic tails and knuckles or you can choose to be the dr eggman shadow and rougeeach team through stages in their own path and the end result of each path comes together the stages are fun to play as the various characters have their own styles of missions and questsin addition there is also a multiplayer fighting mode you can do an action race battle where four soniclike characters each with their own strengths and weaknesses get to race along tracks there are treasurehunt races and shooting battlesfor some the best part are the chao parts of the game a chao is a little creature you raise from an egg depending on how you raise it the creature can turn out good and loving or dark and evil you can then race your chaos or let them karatebattle each other its your own little gamecube blackandwhite creature definitely a game with something for everyone whether your gaming addiction tends towards racing fighting or creaturerearing
fter two days of using this limited edition on my hands and for eye candy i can finally see why this is a such a big deal the glossy finish on the front and back makes up for its unique architecture the shiny design makes this thing stand out in public to get any nintendo fans eye to make them want his one as well i would say that this would be well worth it for a pokemon fan that does not have a ds xl just yet or is game collector like myself i thought it was pretty clever that nintendo decides to put the new starters on the back of the console itself with the new th gen pokemon the stylus is plain black and the button layout is the same but dont get discouraged the are only two bad things about this device since the design has this glossy finish it will get a lot of smudges and finger prints on it get a plastic clear case for this beauty the second would be the high demand for its price that has been risen up after its first day of release gamestop and retailers should be able to have this still in stock after that day i pre ordered this item at gamestop do not buy this at amazon because the price is not fair
max payne for the playstation is not worth the money the graphics and sound are amazing but the gameplay is frustratingly choppy and not very responsive when three or four gangsters are shooting at you the frame rate becomes extremely slow and it becomes impossible to aim your weapon correctly i rented it found the cheat codes and beat it in eleven hours total the game is impossible to play on the ps because the ps can not handle the smooth frame rate that is required if you have a decent pc i suggest you buy it for that particular platform it was a fun hours though for a good ps firstperson shooter try red faction or half life
i bought this recently and although it has a few good things i dont like the game too much because it is frustratingthe graphics are good but not greatthe level design is confusing because you can take different routes and can achieve the objectives in any orderthe ai in this game is quite smartunlike some of the other ww games i have played which is kinda nicethe hit detection in this game is offit is frustrating when you are shooting at an enemy soldier and he wont go down right away but in the meantime you are getting blasted by other enemy soldiersi think if ea would have spent a little more time on this to address certain issues it would have been a better gamei have played both the call of duty games and the earlier medal of honor games and none managed to piss me off like this gamewhoever said that this game is better than call of duty world at war is sadly mistaken world at war is a hell of alot better than this
ive been syked for brothers in arms since i first saw its trailer in june when i finally got it an extreme feeling of excitment came over me i knew i was in for something extrodinarie before i continue let me just say i wasnt wrong at all in thinking this after completing the game about an hour ago i feel as though i have made friendships and also lost several the men of fox company nd regiment of the st airborne come alive in brothers in arms they arent dumb ai bots running into walls and getting killed for not returning fire they are smart almost to the point of creepiness level after level i was continuely worrying about the welfare of my men not because i couldnt survive without them but because i didnt want to survive without them i wanted to see all of my men through to the end sadly not all of them can be saved and your always wondering who is going to die next as you get closer to the end of the game you begin to feel that the rest of your has a chance the games opening scene is intense with violence as well as profanity it is brutal and sets the mood for the scene that follows dont go into brothers in arms thinking its another win game many of the levels are sad and some moments are downright scary if youve viewed no experienced and enjoyed the film band of brothers this game will appeal to you the story is so gripping i literally played it for hours straight until i beat it the gameplay in brothers in arms is solid enough to get use to fairly quick and both the games sound and visuals are top notch the weapons in brothers in arms are true to life weapons that feel more real than ever before you need to be precise in your aiming be careful where you take cover and think like a soldier because two well placed shots is enough to drop you over all brothers in arms on the xbox is very nice and offers split screen multiplay online play and tons of extras check this game out its incredibley goodthanks for reading
drill dozer for gameboy advance came out after the nintendo ds had already been introduced because of this the game went largely unnoticed by the gaming community i read a review in nintendo power suggesting it and then i got an excellent price for it on amazon this game has it all intense action puzzle solving character development through upgrades some permanent some temporary there are many hidden secrets throughout the levels and hardcore gamers will find that pursuing all unlockables will take you back and forth throughout the levels as you acquire upgrades that make previously unreachable areas available if you still own a gameboy advance this is one of the greatest games made for the system in spite of owning a nintendo dsi and a lot of games i still found this title highly entertaining and contemporary collectors and gamers buy play and rejoice
well its a game thats a cross from tamagotchi and the sims haha well you can create miis import your miis and have street pass on to get miis while walking around i find most people have that feature off though lol but anyways you start with this empty island you create your first me usually yourself and they pop up in an apartment each mii gets their own apartment and as you nourish each mii and help encourage socializing with the other miis and buying the correct foods and clothes and things for each of the miis personalities you get money and items to help keep feeding and clothing and what not your mii population as the mii population grows and you keep your miis happy the town opens up one store after another all the while you still have to feed talk to buy clothes etc for each one so as your island grows in population your whole day is shot by having to socialize with all your miis haha so far i only scratched the surface but im sure the interactions with all the miis gets a little complicated later for now as its been sort of entertaining so far oh and the game might have a bug mine kept saying cant read sdhc card although the one supplied by nintendo is still there
i am just going to come out and say it i am a saw fan like a really big saw fan so when i heard that they were making a game i couldnt wait and i think the wait was worth it now before i continue you should know that this is not a game to revolutionize games its just a really fun puzzle game lets start with the puzzlesthe puzzles are of a good variety from manipulating rooms to find the combination manipulating your perspective so you know which way to go and pretty much all of the traps that you have come to love from the saw movies some of these will challenge you and actually make you think because you will have to really change the way you look at some of these puzzles in order to finish themanother part is the combat now its not the best set up but you get used to it the character does hit a little slow but that did not stop me from finishing it you will use weapons from the nail bat shovel scalpel and a revolver also you will find schematics in order to create traps you can also disarm and rearm the shotgun trip wire traps for anyone that might be following you i will say that you will be picking locks setting fuses and shutting off gas pipes a good amount this is the repetitive part of the game but its not that badi should mention that this is probably a game for saw fans only that is because unless you like the story characters and all around saw atmosphere you might not be able to get past the less then perfect combat or some of the repetitive puzzles but i will tell you why you should give it a try anyway one is the length this is one of the few games with a good length in the campaign so you will not be done in like three hours another reason is the trophies if you are looking for trophies then this is your game i finished the game today and only needed one more trophy before a platinum so even if the saw movies arent you thing go out and try this game because you will never know until you try it
the graphics on this game are really good but who wants a dodge neon impreza lancer es peugot those cars suck monkey balls nissan skyline gtr r or toyota suprathese cars are absolute beast the game gets kinda repetitive though like youre doing the same race over and over again slightly more difficult each time overall it is definitely worth the purchase as we all wait for gt to drop in december youll just get bored really fast but maybe thats because most of the time i play alone it is a lot more fun when youre racing friends because ai will bore you after a few days hope this was helpfulpeac
sports needs to stick to making hockey games thats what they do the best at in my opinion madden fifa nascar nba are all good but their hockey games rule in they have many new features like the card based system where you get special goodies to help you in the game plus they brought old features from back like the dittie importer team creator and face generator the gameplay in is better its more realistic and has music during all the breaks and just feels more realistic the players do special dances and stuff when the score goals and they show continous stats a new feature is the crowd momentum had just the momentum bar has the momentum bar for the players and for the crowd the more goals you score the louder the crowds get and then youre team gets more pumped up this is one of the most realistic sports games to date the nhl series is my favorite of them all and if you like any other nhl games im sure youll like this one
i just got the game from amazon the game comes with the limited edition and it instructs me to go to mycrysiscomlimitededition to download so i can take advantage of the benefits i created an account but could never receive the instructions to activate my email hence i cant create an account because of this i cant post at the forums either i click their helpsupport link and found a link for a but clicking it loops me on the same page over and over with no contact form showing upso as i write this im installing the game but i can not download the limited edition download to take advantage of the benefits it promisesive requested the activation email to be sent times now still nothing i bought crysis first with the intention to play crysis after but so much for that now
this was my first wii game besides wii sports i bought this game thinking i was buying a adventure free roaming game like the old rayman games i was a bit dissappointed when i got it home and realized that it was a bunch of minigames but the dissappoiointment soon faded and i began to laugh and so did my wife this game is so much fun shooting rabbids with plungers throwing cows running like a mad rayman with an exploding gift and dancing the night away this has to be one of my favorite wii games i have yet to have any friends over to play this particular game but my wife thinks its fun she also thinks its a little violent there are some levels where you hit a ribbid in the head with a hammer its kinda disturbing parents if you buy this game for your kids you may want to have a long disscussion about why you dont hit the fuzzy white pet rabbit with a hammerall in all i do recommend this game loads of fun and great replaybility
this is seriously the most useless game case i have ever used you can fit exactly two controllers into the case you can fit quite a few games in the provided holder but this is very risky because the sleeves are too loose and the games can easily slip out and get scratched you could potentially fit another controller or some games in cases in the top compartment that is if the power brick didnt take up over of the space the package says it was designed to work with either the or the original xbox console and while it can at least accommodate the console itself its clear that this was designed with the original box in mind because its intensely inconvenient to use with the this thing was a complete waste of thirty bucksgo buy the officially licensed backpack from madcatz its a sad sad day when im forced to endorse madcatz its more expensive but youll end up getting something else if you buy the gpak anyway
heard about this game when it first came out years ago so im years late in playing it but better late than never the game is surprisingly good realllly reallly good it is the only game that ive ever played that made me feel as if i was watching a movie and playing as the main character in that movie the game is really just that good the graphics gameplay music voice work are great the enemy ai is really impressive but main thing that i liked about the game was the camera it didnt suck in a few games that i played i was faced with camera issues that ruined game play and the experience of playing the game a bit but as i played this game i didnt have any annoying camera issues that drove me nuts and i was able to have fun playing the game especially during combat a very high quality produced game kudos to the team that put this one together well done looking forward to playing gears of war ii
this game basicly goes like this there are worlds two of which you have to unlock first so you start out with worlds a grassy world a lava world a water world and the icy world theres no order on how you go to the worlds so you pick which world you go to each world has levels level is a normal stage level is a semi boss stage level is like level but its bigger and more complex and level is the boss of the world once you beat the boss you beat the world beat all of em to unlock the th world the fortress once you get all the gold cards you get a new world i like to call the rainbow worldbut anyways bomberman is a game where you click a button and a bomb pops up right where your standing you can either kick it at your enemy throw it or pump it up to make a big bomb which causes more damage than a normal bomb sometimes you have to do a tricky bomb jump puzzle which i still have trouble doing this game can get complicated to so its very tricky took me awhile to complete it so if you want a long game i think this is for you espicially for the expert i love the variety of enemies in the game i woundnt call this a game for a begginer at all i find it fun to look for body parts in this game its hidden and i mean hidden in each normal stage there is of em its tricky to find so you need lots of luck to find emi think thats all for this reveiw in the end i hope you get it bomberman is a star in nintendo and your about to find out why i presume
just when i was ready to give this game the highest compliment ever i ran into a frustrating rerun of the most astounding cinematics i have seen in tr yet but only to have it repeated so many times that it became frustrating as i could not beat the timing being on the bike and just had to watch over and over until i made the bike run successful must have taken tries had to stop and continue the next day other than that i found it very comfortable and not many other challenges too steep to keep me from continuing through to the end i just figure that a computer game should be more relaxing and entertaining and this seemed to fill that need best yet in the tr series my perspective anyway finally no required with inadequate controlling aspects no seemingly impossible feats and kindly little time challenges that seem to run over again til you want to puke i am playing this over again a second time right away really liked how she could bounce up between walls sometimes with quick grabs even though it seemed as nothing was there to hold on to but she found a grip often but not always when you absolutely are lost with seemingly no idea of how you can possibly continue the game i used to have no course but to refer to some kind of literary help book where now you can just into an area now where you can get a vague hint of what to do next or even a further specific hint should you want to inquire into her thoughts further i really liked this and found myself doing it often then i would feel a bit stupid but at least was able to flow on with the game and not wander aimlessly for long frustrating hours yaaaaa something very close to great fun for a change my question is why did it take so long to arrive at something that is actually fun for a change and not just a challenge the graphics of the surroundings hug you like a well earned vacation and sometimes seems as if you are actually on vacation virtually serene often the puzzles of course are great well thought out and have to admire how it was all put together you will love this one for the most part it should be the template for most games i think if you can put it down long enough because you need some rest you are able to do that you wont be so frustrated that you are unable to get that needed sleep just what a game should be healthy for the soul for a change
i liked this game but i grew bored with it pretty quickly i think that you can play two ways either with the remote turned sideways or with the wiichuck connected to the remote i must have a defective wiichuck because the only way that i could ever play the game was to just turn the controller sideways maybe i would have enjoyed it more if i could have gotten it to work the other way i dont knowanother thing that i had a problem with was the fact that there are only four games i thought there would be more there is hockey basketball dodgeball and volleyball of the four basketball is probably my favorite followed by dodgeball but i wish i had more options i still recommend this game its just not a very strong recommendation
i am not a wrestling fan at all however a friend talked me into buying the game with no expecatations i think this should be fairthe game is a slower game than other fighting games however from what i have seen of wwf it represents itself perfectly wwf is not hongkong fooey fighting it is stage theatrics that have calculated moves to entice ethusiams and support for a particular wrestler the graphics are outstanding and the sounds are great personally i have not won a match yet i have only played about and i certainly am gettting the hang of itmy advice is to understand what you want from a game then decide if you want raw think of it this way if you really want a fighting game get dead or alive if you want the thrill and fantasy of being a member of the wwf get raw it is fun and mixing it up with a couple of mates over a few pints will only increase that fun
this game was pretty darn good rainbow six black arrow is more than an expansion than a sequel but with all the new maps and modes it sure feels like one the biggest and best thing about this game is its multiplayer aspect there are like maps to play along with a lot of different game modes these modes consist of sharpshooter terrorist hunt mission survival team survival and two new modes total conquest and retrieval all of these are each very fun but the new ones are especially enjoyable they all play very well on the new maps and it seems that the new modes were planned very well according to the layout of those new maps the maps are larger than previous rainbow six games but they are all very nice and work well the retrieval mode is probably my favorite it is pretty much one flag capture the flag except instead of a flag there is a canister each time spawns on different ends of the map with the canister in the center the whole point is to retrieve the canister and bring it to your drop area when the time ends whoever has the most scores wins it is a really addicting game type and along with sharpshooter it is probably my favoriteoverall this game is one of the most addicting online player games there has been its fast its fun and although it can sometimes be challenging it can keep people playing for hours on end the graphics are very nice the online modes are insane and there are so many maps to choose from its crazy the graphics could be a bit better but instead of changing them a lot from rainbow six they instead improved the game play added modes and maps and made the online experience truly addicting and fun
this is one of those games where you spend most of your time either walking around talking to people about a million things or staring at the screen trying to figure out what little blemish you missed on the floor that needs to be examined in order to continue overall i thought it was well executed for this type of game however the most annoying aspect of it was the character movementit was very clumsy and sluggish and there were times i wished for a feature to speed things up if you like hunt and search games with an excellent story and lots of conversations to pay attention to then this is for you
western game never caught my attention but a friend of mine told me how great it was so i decided to give it a try well now i can say this is probably the best sandbox game ever beating and surpassing gta iv huge open world great story telling and high production gameplay graphics music voice acting incredible multiplayer and mini games like poker blackjack horse shoe throwing arm wrestling finger filet duels wow it is a long game compared to others it took me around hours to beat the main story with a of total completion there are tons of side quests challenges treasure hunting stranger missions live ever changing environment wild animals that can easily attack you if not aware taming horses and jobs you can take through the game many living characters in all towns across the united states and mexicogreat challenge but achievable crossing the border from us to mexico through rio bravo was epic the good thing with red dead redemption is that you have checkpoints inside a mission so if you get killed you dont have to start over from the beginning of the mission like gta iv so this makes the game more friendly for the player a lot of moral values like the difference between good and bad faith loyalty love and betrayalthe ending was incredible because it gives you a hint of what will be next for the franchise in the future and after beating the game you still have a lot of things to do and play believe me everything connects and you really care about the charactersalso an expansion is available called undead nightmare which is also incredible and adds a new single player campaign and more multiplayer to the gamethis is a must buy and a keeper also it was selected the game of the year on the vga awards
kaynow im not a fan of mega man and i have only played this mega man which i recieved as a christmas present years ago i recently put this up on a rummage sale for after playing it about times in two years well i just took it off because i figured out they are paying mad prices for it on so im gon na sell mine there for about anyways i played this timesout of the two years ive had it and my th time was the day before the rummage which was two days agomy advice is that if you like cartoons then this is for you nothing but cartoon humor cartoon mischief cartoon talking cartoon bubblesthe whole game is a cartoon i guess if you have liked mm for awhile mm would be good for you but not for the average gamer if i had to rate this at an age scale i would say it is from ages my lil step bro likes it and he begged me to play it and he did even though he totally as iti watched him play it and it was a cartoon the only cool part was the tvlike anime at the beginning i have the collectors edition and there are only ever pressed i collect things but this i must say even though there is a limited number and they are no longer making this i have to sell it i wont ever play it and i wouldnt ever spend the money to put this in a plaque cuz it just isnt worth the moneyso to wrap it upif youve liked mega man or youre intrested in the mega man legacyor for that matter if you like cartoons then this is for youand yes agreeing with one person that said this earliermega man sounds like his little sister
i personally like many types of fighting games and fun is the thing that keeps me coming back for more a game can have pretty graphics sound great and have all the bells and whistles in the world and still play like this game might not be as pretty as the saturn version but who wants a saturn one of the biggest flops since the future flop of sonys ps a few frames missing and slowdown which i have not experienced personally are by no means reasons to dismiss a game that combines xmen with streetfighter very well one more thing to mention about the price not to insult anyones intelligence but simply supply and demand it is discontinued there are fewer and fewer copies available thus causing those on the open market to raise in value
ssasins creed is a great addition to the assasins creed series ive been playing since ac and although the ac concept is getting a bit long in the tooth i have to say ac really hit it out of the park everything seems just a bit better than ac the game flows better easier to get around a lot less dead space the ship battles are like a whole new game in itself i have spent the last week happily at sea taking on ever more challenging battles adding ships to my fleet doing trading runs making lots of money definitely many many hours of game playthe only down side like all assasins creed game is the game starts kind of slow and it take a while for things to pick up ok one more thing i dont like your crew sings songs known as shanties you start of with two in order to get more songs you have to chase down the shanties in parts of town basically a chaseplatform type quest i personally hate those thus i dont have a lot of shanties but im really nit picking herei thought i was done with the the series but this is what ac should have been so if you were turned of by that title i suggest you put your cloak on and give it one last go this is a much better way to end your assasins career and may even make you look for to ac
second sight has a brilliant story and a great idea behind the gameplay you take on the role of john vattic who wakes up in a secure hospitalresearch facility with a battered scarred body and a killer headache he has no idea how he got there or what these people want with him but he soon learns that he has extraordinary psychic powers such as telekinesis selfhealing astral projection and the ability to possess baddiesso begins your quest to find out the whos and whys obviously theres a huge government conspiracy behind everything but the game has a unique storytelling twist as you play one level in the present and the next in the past at the beginning of the story its a unique way of developing interest and involving you more in the mysteryits very cool being able to sneak up on the baddies and tossing them around like ragdolls with your telekinesis chucking them through windows off high ledges slamming them into walls and ceilings is loads of fun but i think this could have been taken further as it was a great opportunity for some cool gory deaths and the simple blood splatters werent really enoughthe levels vary between hospitals siberian outposts apartments more hospitals offices sewers labs and even more hospitals for the most part they are pretty generic and ludicrously oversized to make the game longer it can get a bit boring wandering around for ages avoiding torrents of gunfire anxiously awaiting a quiet moment to pull yourself togetherthe music also walks a thin line of being atmospheric or generic sometimes it can get on your nerves and sometimes it can add to the tension of a scene the voice acting is a cut above most games however and john vattics accent kinda grows on you theres also a twist which i wont spoil for you that makes the games complicated plot perfect for a theatrical filmits fun but its long and there are a few annoying bits and if second sight was more developed and detailed it would be a classic as it is its merely fast foodgraphics bsound bgameplay blasting appeal b
while it is a bit short be overly nosey and really poke around the game can extend if you like to dig for every power item beautifully graphic game real eye treat for me worth replay so that is a very good thing even more so as you will learn from past slowdown mistakes so my reason for adding this review is to just toss out a little advice for folks that have not played this yet dont worry about winning the first time just play and die and play and die and learn what to collect and get used to what abilities you can upgrade to and special powers get used to jumping and rooting around and a handle on where to look then delete and start over with a purpose you will know what power of attributes you want to spend the power up on early and really get them up and the game will be so much more funspecial hint and maybe a bit of a spoileryou can pick an ability to call a pack of rats to devour people the larger the power up the more ratstrust me you will learn to love this and it is the best timeand if you wait till a line of enemies is in a line and loose the rats i swear it is like a monty python thingthey jump and dance and yowl in a chorus line unison as the rats swarm their legs and it is totally hilarious
first let me say i really wanted to like this game and was very excited for its release the gameplay trailers looked superb and the details surrounding the games complete redesign sounded more than promising when i popped this game into my ps and connected to my preferred game mode team death match i was ready for bfbc taken to the next level man was i disappointed long story short this shooter plays moves and feels just like medal of honor also by dice a game largely regarded as a failure the first thing i noticed was that the graphics were nothing like the screen shots found in magazines and the videos posted on you tube i feel deceived in that regard granted the graphics are more polished than bfbc and more though no where near the level of polish in the previews and even though the game looks great the level design does not promote direct or indirect engagements it promotes lots of campingnext and more importantly how does the game play well first of all it feels nothing like bfbc in terms of gameplay gone are the smooth controls and methodical engagements of bfbc moving aiming and shooting does not feel anywhere as refined as bfbc again it feels almost exactly like dices medal of honor the team death match level designs are as others have said campers and now that you can lay down it becomes impossible to spot snipers in bfbc you could get sniped but you could usually spot your shooter not here also out the gates using the iron sights it is almost impossible to rack any kills as you engage from so far away and you will find yourself by new attachments like lasers and that will literally obscure of your screen with light your and completely obscure the person shooting you which to me is a really new feature that will turn off more seasoned playersi strongly doubt that the same developers behind bfbc produced this game but i can absolutely guarantee that the same developers behind medal of honor made this game and like medal of honor it plays miserably avoid
this game is surprisingly fun to play i still dont understand why ign gave this game or so they probably expected too much from this game after hyped it up so much however thanks to ign i was able to go into this game with much lower expectations im pretty sure if i were going into this game expecting ldre i would be disappointed think of this game as a socomre fusioni didnt expect ai to be great i mean when was the last time i saw a great ai system mw me binary domain lol maybe in uncharted or ais are meant to be dumber than the actual players that is why we play coopcompetitive games online this game was built for the online play from the beginningall i can say is that i am blown away by how solid a tps this game is also dont go into this game expecting call of duty in the competitive mode
shadow hearts is an interesting game rather than taking place in a fantasy setting like most rpgs it takes place in a more supernatural version of our own worldvirtually everything about this game is great the hero yuri is one my favorite videogame protagonists interesting well fleshedout and engaging a lot of the dialogue is hilarious the plot is interesting and very unpredictable and some of the scnearios create a genuine sense of fear and uneasethe battles are a lot of fun with the use of the ring system so that the fights are a test of reflexes as well as strategythe only fly in the ointment is the graphics theyre not as bad as some reviews here suggest by any means but they are somewhat lackluster but dont let that stop you from trying this great game
this game continues where the previous ones left off this game seems easier to play and has a high replay value there is a mode in which the players compete through a series of the quotgame boardsquot to gather quotpresentsquot to add to a display in a certain part of game i have not gathered them all yet as i have only had the game a few weeksto players of the previous gamesslot car racing is gone if youre like me that is a good thing theres also none of the quotrotate the stickquot games that produced many blistersthe game is suitable for all ages and it is easy enough to pick up on that it may replace scrabble on borad game night
i wasnt going to write a review about this game i tend to leave game reviews to those who take gaming far more seriously than i do but after playing this game for a few days i rented it from gamefly it will be going back shortlyfirst of all i love rpg games that have good epic stories i really was enjoying the story in this game so far and i have not read the books nor have i watched the tv shows associated with this story so it was all new to me i was really excited about this game until the frustration set in clunky controls that made battle a nightmare getting trapped in the scenery super dark areas of the game where you really can not see what is going on then getting trapped in some more sceneryi have been playing entered a battle scene and suddenly realized that my guy is fist fighting where are his weapons i wonder then realize that i must have hit some button that made him want to fist fight his way through a boss battle who knows how many fights i had been without my weapons since it is so dark i can hardly figure out what is going on in the fight scenes and yes i have adjusted the brightness so i have spent the last hour pinned in the corner by a guy who is supposed to be helping me he follows me everywhere i go and heaven forbid i go into a corner because he will pin me there its the fifth time he has done it my only potion at that point is to exit the game and restart from the last autosavemy frustration with the mechanics is causing me to return this game uncompleted im sure it will help my blood pressure in the end i am very upset about it because i was really enjoying the storyperhaps try this on another platform if you really want it i would rent it first to see if you encounter the same issues i did
playboy the mansion is a very good strategy game getting good content for your magazines proves to be a very deep and envolving task forget about the sexual content after about minutes the topless women become secondary and yes there is sex but its with underwear on and its not sexy at all its actually funny the first few times but also gets old the unlockables are forgettable who wants to see playmates damn where women ugly back then look and youll see at least compared to the couple of modern playmates you can unlock however i found it fun to pump out issues trying to max out the market to get maximum exposure the graphics are ok but you would have figured a game which focuses on hot women would have made them in a clearer and more pronounced way the music once you buy a stereo or a dj station is good you actually chose a type and it sounds really good i was impresssed overall by this game and would reccommend it to adults only and strategy game fans i enjoyed this sims type game
im a huge fan of the older resident evil games and have enjoyed every one however this was my least favorite i did enjoy exploring raccoon city but didnt like the forced encounters with nemesis the game actually was made to tie up loose ends from resident evil which it did but the story just seemed to be an after thought lacking the attention the developers gave to the previous games the game looked great as usual and the developers managed to push the ps hardware further than previous games in regards to graphical effects the little details like water shooting from fire hydrants moths around light fixtures and mice running about on the floor as you walked by added to the ambiance all in all a fun game though not quite as good as the others in the series
i downloaded the demo version of the game and played it through i love it i fully intend upon buying it it has wonderful graphics and lots of options normally unheard of likeyou have a character that is a fighteryou can get a spellbook fill it with spells and bamyou are now a mage no penalties and you can always switch back not only that but you can work multiple skills at different times in order to raise your stats and you dont get slapped with a penalty for switching back and forth items and spells normally have to be found you arent handed them on a silver platter and your health and mana regenerate naturallywhich is great and the real time ai of the monsters are very challenging and if they arentbump up the difficulty and there you go im very impressed after everquest daoc asherons call bg and all of its clones and diablo this game is a breath of fresh airnow if only neverwinter nights would hurry up and come outlol
i just wanted anyone considering purchasing this game to know this although i loved this game when it first came out the developers have completely abandoned it and when you try to play online you are playing with hackers and cheaters and the experience is totally ruined i called the publisher as well as microsoft and complained that a game that is still sold new on store shelves has not been patched to fix this huge problem neither calls gave me a satisfactory answer very disappointing as i would still play these online they were some of the best mp experiences of all time back before this happened please do not give a cent to these people buy it used cheap if you want the single player
iolent who cares isnt that what rachet and clank is all about this is a great game for anyone who likes warfareshooting and most of allrachet amp clank of coursealso whats with all these people who are saying its just like the first yeah maybe the main charactershaha there is almost nothing the same between going commando and the original rachet and clank going commando has a better storyline and just all around better gaming not to mention its great to just run around and blow up the little furballs with weapons like the plasm blaster or the blaster cannonthe game is so great you start out being hired by some guy and then you come to find out this guy mr fizzwidget is actually bad this game is very long well worth the money and if there was anything higher than a tis game would deserve itheres a breakdown of the basic elements to any video gamegraphicsgameplay simple but loads of funfun getting to run around and blast those furry little pets or robotsit doesnt get any betterdifficulty from fighting huge furballs to battling in the gobe desert its a real challengeoverall excellent game worth every penny and just overall fun to play with infinate replay value and a long game this is deffinately a best buyin the end this game is way above average there are only a handful of games that come withing miles of this gameall in all insanely great job sony youve made a great game buy this game you have to try out this game
this game was an overall good game it still has somewhat the feel of the first one but it is very different it is missionbased and you complete the game by completing missions for each character you have to complete all the current missions to go on each mission can take between minutes and hours to do they are frustrating but they give you a lot of gameplay and experience this is a game that you need to buy to complete if you can give hours a day to game playing it will take you a couple weeks to beat there are about long missions by the end of the game i had hours on the clock yes there is a clock that calculates how long you playedmy only main complaint is that getting through the city can be a drag if you dont have the security passes getting through the city can take a while since its not laid out like vice city its more of a maze but this a minor thing and i feel this is a worthy buy
ight so im not a huge fantasy guy in fact i dont like star wars or lord of the rings dragons swords magic and all that crap are overrated to me now when you have time on your hands and there isnt a whole of games out there that grab your attention but this underdog title has great reviews youre bound to try itthis games ballin yeah its got so much simplicity to it that you dont have to get some crazy algorithm down to get your characters stats up the combat is fluid and satisfying and very similar to fable the whole game is a lot like fable and im not talking about the crap sequels were talkin the classic one theres dialogue to every character its simple to understand and play its got a story that keeps you going and even the side quests are great to get yourself immersed intothe games worth every penny and on a replayability level i cant stop making new characters just to try out the different destinies and what the play styles might be im all about finess and killing people from behind theres enough exploration that it feels small but big at the same time its all such a weird presentation that you think so there aint much but its an impressive game and i would recommend this to just about anyone
im a disgruntled and disappointed owner i waited eagerly for the to be released and when i finally saved up my money i picked one up as soon as i could i was very pleased by the the graphics are slick the controller is the best of the next gens and xbox live is user friendly and innovate for a while there it seemed that we were a perfect match my xbox and i but that all changed when one day i turned it on and i saw what every owner dreads the red rings of death after less than a year the thing just up and died i kept it cool and ventilated never played it for more than three or so hours at a time i was a very responsible owner but it just broke i sent it in and bill gates fixed it and sent it back with in a couple weeks i was hurt but i was willing to try our relationship again for a while things were like the good old days and i watching movies and playing games good times i was planing to spend even more time with my by picking up halo butyou guessed it it just broke for the second time now i have a broken and an unplayed copy of halo collecting dust on my tv stand im just frustrated and i feel like i made a very poor investment by buying the the thing is just not manufactured well and microsoft should of made sure that the bloody thing worked before releasing it not all xboxs break but thousands do the gamble is up to you i bought the to have fun but so far its caused me nothing but frustration and headaches
i dont need to add to all the glowing positivity that it credibly gains so let me nit pickthis major one is the drum pedal snapping so i suggest you reinforce it go to loewes and the lumber section youll find a flat metal hinge plate with holes predrilled its about inches long and wide cost or so get the pedal will snap with use when you become more proficient google for a pic and notice where it snaps get machine screws and bolt down the pedal to reinforce it use loctite when you do so its a mod you must do unless they fixed their flimsy design i snapped my pedal and fixed it like the above works great nowthe guitar fails too where you strum mine did not yet my friends didin terms of sw pgming it has has however this mode does not score you so you cant see your failure point clearly notice i said if you find yourself failing on an exact spot youll see the screen going red before your applausesuccess bar plummets there is no such metering in practice would be nice to haveinspite of these it is a splendid game if you love music particularly if you like to drum sing air guitar with a captive audience by willforce or if youre a professional bathroom singer then youll love itsingle player is fun replay value does exist if you like to play music but multiplayer is a hoot and where its atgo ahead and buy it if you love music and particularly any of the supplied musical instruments
its hard to believe that the first wipeout was released years ago on the original sony playstation one since then there was one excellent sequel on the psone wipeout xl known as wipeout in the uk and on the macintosh a decent later sequel wipeout a capable nintendo version wipeout and a fun but dated playstation edition wipeout fusionthe newest game wipeout pure combines the best elements of all of these games like all of them the action is fast the framerate is smooth the difficulty is high and a pulsing techno soundtrack follows you wherever you go you get the usual single race series tournament series time attacks and practice laps all of which open up more tracks and speeds as you finish first in racesthis version adds a bunch of extra ship classes as well as a terrific zone option right from the start without needing to unlock anything in zone mode you just go faster and faster until you crash a sign of things to come on the later roundsthe main limitations ive had with this game are because of the hardware i find that the analog nubbin is not comfortable to use for long periods of time and the built in speakers do not do justice to the great spatial sound effects and music fortunately the digitial controls are solid and comfortable and the psps stock headphones make listening to the game while you play an absolute joythis is a great game and a showcase for both the terrific wipeout series and the brandnew psp hardware even though both the wipeout brand and the playstation brand are old now pure and the psp have breathed new life into this classic racerget it
member how much fun doom was well serious sam is a definate throwback to doom and doom there is nonstop action in this game great weapons and graphics there are several instances in serious sam where you are just swarmed with monsters coming at you i believe monsters was the most on the screen at the same time pretty intense fun fun is the key word here youll have a lot of fun playing serious sam if you dont like fps you may like this one for sheer action there isnt much story but who cares the whole reason this game was made was to make a doomstyle game with a ton of enemies coming at you it isnt to hard for newcomers either there arent a lot of eloborate puzzles to solve just a lot of shooting of monsters croteam has made an impressive game here people the graphics are indeed stunning but i am no expert when it comes to grapics but it looks just as good as the quake engineto top it all off this game is seriously fun
i like that the turtle beach headsets have the builtin sound since i work at night and this way i can turn off the tv volume and not wake my husband up when i playchat thats about the best thing i can say about this productwhen i got my headset a little over a year ago the cable did not work properly i had to turn it a certain way to get the mic to work and if i moved the mic function would cut off this seemed to subside after awhile and got better but now the chat function refuses to work at all unless i push part of the cable in towards the volume control unit basically i need to buy their replacement cable imo this should not be happening after a year its not like these headsets are inexpensive by any meansthe worst thing about turtle beach headsets as many others have noticed is the buzzing whenever the mic function does decide to work there is a constant annoying buzzing sound in my ear it ranges from loud to quiet depending on the day but its always irritating i thought it was a defect until i read so many complaints about the same thing and realized all of these headsets are like thatthe headphones are bulky and hurt my head after awhile this is a minor complaint next to the poor quality talkback cable and the constant annoying buzzing soundi sort of compare these to beats by dre poor quality but they sell like hot cakes for an expensive price due to their brand name
i dreamed about having this game for a while and when i finally got my xbox it was the first thing i went for first off i thought this was a two player game but nope second sure all the cars are wonderful but the majority of the well know cool ones are unlocked by level i just stopped playing for lack of incentive third at times especially when you have to chase down the one racer your hits do little to not nearly as much damage as they should fourth when you have to respond to the scene as a cop you get added three sec every time you hit a rail meaning you have to be flawless which is not very realistic when having to avoid traffic and drive for decent amounts of time min in daytime much less night time the only positive thing i can think to say is you can customize your controls in short if your looking for a day moderately challenging game to play with friends online every now and then then this is your game but i like to see more from my games
n hours and fortythree minutes is how long it took me to beat this game and i enjoyed every bit of time it took me to do so almost hours doesnt sound like much but in my old age i am realizing i like the games that can be completed without devoting my life to finishing itthis game has everything that makes a good actionadventure game incredible graphics good control fantastic handdrawn artwork imaginative environments befitting music to set the mood etca new feature to the actionadventure genre is the addition of the bird kuzo the birds ability to fly ahead of you and scout out the lay of the land is very cool and works very wellthis game has many moments of fullon combat with numerous enemies as well as times when it can be played with tenchulike stealth missions i enjoyed this game very much and will look forward to the continuing adventures of rau and kuzo
well i have had this game for a few years now i got it when they were offering the beta for halo at the time i loved the game it was a good idea very in depth had some fun weapons and the vehicles were simply amazing i played this game countless times and logged many hours of play making sure to build up the perfect character once i beat all the bosses though the game got stale because at the time there was no patch to make them respawn so there was really nothing to do but shoot random people recently i plugged it in for a quick refresh on the game and saw that they had a patch to allow respawn of bosses well the fun is back again this added a lot more gameplay to the game i am in teh process of replaying the game i would recommend this game to buy for anything or less remember it is a crime fighting game but it does have some rpg elements you collect orbs to level up your skills which you get for killing characters a certain way or from exploring and finding xp drops you shoot a guy you get xp in gun skills hand to hand with someone you get better combat skills etc and yes you can pick up cars and chuck em across the map
this is truly a wonderful system it is true that very good games are lacking for it right now but great games are on the way for the system such as factory luigis mansion kingdom hearts d paper mario harvestmoon land of beginings dsthats just a few good games that are on the way for this system this system is worth buying of course everything has its flaws nothing is perfectthe main complaint about this system is the battery life if you put the brightness setting on the lowest level and select power saving mode the battery will last up to five or six hours of game play thats a decent amount of play time before the system needs to be charged however if you are the type to play a game longer than five to six hours at a time it would be best if you use the system with the ac adapter so you dont have to worry about running out of power while you are playing a game over all this is a great system everyone just has to be patient with the games they are on the way
i suppose halo is a good multiplayer game but i bought it mainly because it was on sale for the solo content in that respect is is lacking the solo game is short i finished it in less than a week the goals are confusing at times without enough info to understand what they wantyou end up guessing a lot no map you have all this high tech armor but no map of your location the graphics are ok but no better than unreal tournament iithere is the rub this game wasnt as entertaining as the old unreal tournament and the graphics werent any betterif you want team based multiplayer this is probably a good game otherwise it is mostly just overhyped
having used both the ps and xbox one controller and their respective predecessor here is my take on the ps controller compared to the ps controller the redesigned ps controller is better in almost every way possible instead of being an evolution of the ps controller this one is a completely revolutionary design the biggest difference of this controller is the touchpad on it and while not many games have incorporated the use of the touchpad at launch killzone is one the games that does have touchpad support there is a huge potential for games to incorporate the use of the touchpad the inclusion of a speaker on the controller is another nice feature with big potential so far i have only seen it be used in resogun and killzone playing audiolog there is a light in the front of the controller that has replaced the controller light on the ps again another feature that has potential depending on how developers use it in fifa the color of the light represent the color of the user controlled player in the game player is red player is blue etc now it is up to game developers to include the touchpad functionality and use the controllers speaker in their game it will be very interesting to see how those features will be implemented the controller is also more ergonomical this time around since i have fairly large hands i have found the xbox controllers to be more comfortable to use compared to the playstation controller however that is a wash this time around as the overall design of the ps controller is very comfortable and ergonomic the triggers are now designed to contour to your fingers similar to the xbox controller making it so that your trigger fingers sit their nicely and reduce the chance of slippage from previous design good for those playing with sweaty or greasy fingers and all around a more thoughtful design the back button is now replaced by a share button for sharing all your glorious moments online for your friends to see while the start button is replaced by the option button at first locating and hitting the option button can be frustrating due to its small size and the fact that it is not raised from the controllers surface however after using the controller youll get the hang of it and that will no longer be a big issue so now for the gripes against this controller the first issue with it is the durability issue and there are many reviewers saying that the rubber especially on the left joystickthumbstick is degrading ive had the controller for two months and the rubber is already coming off the second issue is the battery life compared to the ps xbox one and xbox the battery life is the worst on the ps controller hopefully sony will release a revision of the controller that addresses these two issues because this controller has great potential only time will tell
when you start playing you start yawningthe problem with games with prerendered backgrounds is that it completely ruins the pacing of an action game if you look at any action film these days the camera and the elements being filmed all movethis kind of cinematorgraphy goes back to the days of film before d w griffith ie set the camera down and let the actor run around until he leaves the room then set the camera down in a new location and repeatif you like games like resident evil or fear effect this game is for you also if you like solving awkward puzzles this game is for you any time one has to put an awkward puzzle into a game to mix up the game play means that one is totally out of ideas for the game like still cameras awkward puzzles break the pacing of the game
wow where to start this game is absolutely one of the best fps single player adventures of all time the graphics are stunningly beautiful all through the game if this is the unreal engine as some have said all i can say is that unreal never looked near as good as undying does the soundtrack of the game will give you chills the way it compliments the game the load times arent nearly as bad as some previous reviews make it seem clive barker has written an amazing storyline for this game and it was extremely well developed one of the things that always hurts fps games is when the storylines are not developed enough this game is so scary at times i had chills up and down my spine while i explored the monestary and believe it or not i was scared to go into the dark areas of the monestary i have never felt like that in any game i have played i think the monestary past level is probably the best rendered level i have ever seen in any game it was absolutely breathtaking and incredible to explore too this game is awesome all the way around if you havent played it dont wait another second if i had known how good this game was when it first game out i would have gladly paid full price for it its that good
bbids is funny and its different than the first one we have rabbids and its ok but a bit difficult and not really multiplayer which is why we bought it the jokes are funny yet appropriate for kids which is great for parties ok you cant throw the cow in the rabbids ok we do miss that one and yes you can move on to the next game even with a lame score big plus for me but its fun to dress up the rabbids in costumes you can mix and match anything you want rayman has some good costumes as well the instruments are easier to play in rr in rabbids you had to be a maniac to keep the beat and my wife mostly had to do it as im an old rpg player and no way was i going to keep up with the super fast beatrabbids is clearly designed with the wii in mind games are a bit easier to play and instead of being thrown in a cell you get a victory dance for the winner and the loser gets hit by cars or sinks in a boat etcfor parties rabbids is lightyears ahead of rabbids we will be buying rabbids tv party after the holidaysthe rabbids games are offbeat and seriously funny rabbids is for more serious players who want more of a challenge and i will say this the rabbids shooting games are considerably better than rabbids but thats about it replaying games is much easier in rr you can replay any game very easily multiplayer or singleoh and if you dont do well in the shooting game you dont get to fight the boss and if you dont do well in the games you dont get the funnier costumes so you still have to do well rr makes it harder to hit the rabbids who now actually jump out of the way of your shotsthe a button to reload is a pain since you cant use a nyko perfect shotbut overall this is a fantastic party game our friends just love playing this game as a groupif you want a party game this is a top notch one
i love this series i was kind of dissapointed when they left out my favorite monstermonol but i love the pokorins they are cute and everything you could want that is the whole formula that makes this game a sucess memorable monsters everyone i know who has played this game has their favorite mine is pokorin one of my friends is those bird menthe names escape me right now another ones is dragon this game is so great i bought it in september and i have played it almost every night to the begining of december i am probably gon na pick it up again the day after christmas the reason and there is only that i put it down was that i thought i would get sick of it get off your butt grab your walletpurse grab your car keys get in the car go to your nearest video game dealer buy mr go home pop it in your ps play it and do this all now
i got this weeks ago and i can sure say i was impressed the first thing i liked was the new juke move except for the fact that if you hit one of the triggers before the other he stiff arms it helped alot the graphics and commentary were slightly better and the menues were redone in high res the two new features were franchise and network play the franchise was good except for you can only trade away draft picks that were originally yours that means once you trade a team for a pick that pick is yours and you have to keep it also you couldnt see your overall offence and defence ratings which meant i had no indication if my team could win by simulating or if i would have to play the game the network part is what dissapointed me ever since i played starcraft i was amazed at how easy it was to set up a game after playing chu chu and this it made me dislike internet play once again instead of creating a game you must chalange a player this also means only dreamcasts per game also without a keyboard you cant talk to your opponent at all which really disapointed me when nobody ever talked back and also the latency was pretty good when passing or running through the middle but returning a kick or kicking was too hard and even though off line i get yard returns easily online yards is common overall this game is good and worth even though the network mode isnt what i expected it is still good enough for me to play onmadden is looking to kill nflk i played it and the guys looked more real and the physics of tackeling or catching were awesome the guys hands actually have to grab the ball in order for a catch another thing was the franchise mode was much better then k the only thing was with no internet play you have to get a dollar box just to get a person game
this game looked cool after i read about it a month or so before it came out i bought it and i do admit it was fun when i first played it but theres not much to the game after the first few hours the graphics leave much to be desired with simple polygons and such and the zoom levels arent that good you start out with or so to build your mall you will be lost without completing the tutorial which is tricky i needed help from the games message board provided free online just to finish it you build walls entrances atriums and of course stores there are four types of stores to choose from with a good selection of products such as clothes electronics housewares etc but once the mall is built it gets boring there are only like or types of shoppers and it does not show them in your stores they simply walk up to the entrance disappear and then reappear with bags i built an atm and pay phones and no one even used them there are also basic repeating animations such as clerks inside each store which get very boring the game has little replay value it is a cool idea but could have been a lot better
this is a great game but hearing alittle bit about choppas they have the real controlls messed up alittle bit a chopper will straighten out as soon as you let go of the stickit has no choice in the matter the new ones anyways i get into a spot and the chopper will not turn it feels like it is on a spring or being held back by a big rubber band of some sort only when i am in real mode if anyone else has got this problem i dont know a chopper does not do that lolsoon we might get a fix for that i hope
this is a pretty good value for ac fans a game i rated stars the freedom cry campaign is pretty substantial ive already sunk four or five hours into it and i have completed the story but there are still plenty of things for me to do such as maxing out my ships stats and exploring a few islands adewale is a fun character to use with a personality that is distinctly different from his former captain edward kenwaythere is a bunch of multiplayer content as well but i have not had a chance to explore that and im not very interested in ac multiplayer to begin with if you are a big ac online player then the decision to buy this season pass is a nobrainer if however youre strictly interested in the freedom cry campaign keep in mind that you can buy that on its own for half the price of the season passubisoft has continued to release a few things such as the illustrious pirates package which you get free with the season pass there isnt much to it a couple of extra outfits and weapons that can be gained by exploring remote islands but this only takes a matter of minutes to complete my hope is that ubisoft will consider releasing even more single player content given the success and popularity of ac it would be awesome to pilot the jackdaw about the ocean again leading kenways crew to more victoriesmy favorite part of this season pass the kraken sails it might not seem like much but these sails are really awesome for anybody who is a fan of the legendary beast its fun to sail around the caribbean in the jackdaw with the kraken proudly represented on the sails of your ship you get a kraken figurehead and wheel too but i dont really notice them much it more firmly secures kenways legend as the terror of the caribbean
s the protagonist fp shooter is in a solo battle with his enemy without or with little use of semiautomatic weapons as well as fighting at distance the sniper has to plan or set up his next encounter this game has times of no action but time to strategize sometimes often i found that my first plan of action didnt work more than once too and therefore had to come up with a new strategy to accomplish a particular mission this is definitely a game where one at times has to think carefully about hisher next move and the moves after that as well i found this exercise requiring a lot of thought to be quite refreshing as compared with most games set in contemporary times where it seems that you and your team will win by just shooting the most ammo the fastest so if you are looking for a game that makes you think before you move this might be the game for yougreat graphics especially the use of the special shot camera loved those exrays the story was decent and engaging as well as being coherent
i like this game overall but as you can see by the other reviews it does have its flaws what i liked about the game is just the mere fact that it is rather time consuming you dont just put it in and win you have to think and manage your planets carefully the quotnormalquot skill level is just way to hard to be quotnormalquot i havent even wanted to try to play it under quothardquot why bother when i cant even beat it under normali myself havent had any problems with memory but i cant see a lot of the text when the starfield is on this makes it hard to use the quick research function the text is there just cant read it and its not that i have a slow system its a brand new i also think this game is very much like master of orion just not as good well maybe they will come out with another version of master of orion for us
my year old son gets frustrated with many game cube games not because they have problems but because he just isnt that good at them especially compared to his older sister this game is a dream come true to him therere no catchy puzzles or over and over again if he doesnt figure out the to get around an opponent and best of all he gets to be king kong and a trex and other assorted monsters he was also careful to point out to me that though it is based on destruction mayhem its rating is e because theres no gore or blood and it is makebelieve monsters doing the destruction when a monster eats someone it gulps them down whole
i played this game when it first came out but never owned it and never played the expansion pack man was i missing out for the price this was selling at this is the ultimate deal not only do you get the game and the expansion but you get detailed strategy books for both gamesthe graphics are still pretty solid after all these years and the music and sound affects are awesome hey this is blizzard what did i expect the story is very intriguing and quite surprising at the end very well put together and each unit for each race is different as are the buildings with most rts games each faction has different units but they are usually only different in design and name they do the same thing the other factions units do but in starcraft you really need to know what units do to succeed for the zerg they have hydralisks that when seperate are pretty weak but when you group them up and have them attack one target at a time they are very strong and a group of or can wipe out an army or buildings very quickly very unique units and buildingsas with every blizzard game the story is excellent with you controlling all races over missions the eaxpansion pack also lets you play all races over another missions for a total of missions not too bad for any game and the expansion is clearly one of the best there ever has been the cutscenes add to the story and a pretty good graphically and great musically a total joy to play the only downside to the game is playing against another live person i played this game against a friend of mine at least times and we had ties and i won once the crystals and vespene gas run out before a winner could be decided other than that this is an awesome game even today and with this package deal this is an excellent buy happy gaming
this is a game that will have a huge following with some gamers but most with hate it just for its genre and not give it a chance there are many great things about this game but to me there are just too many bad thingsin the good catagory monkey island has great graphics to me it kinda looks like toy story or such cool cgi animation there is a lot of humor as you control the sometimes very ignorant hero on his many adventure or complacated trips for his wife there is also a ton of exploring to do and at every turn there is another puzzle to keep the story moving and to me this is one of the main problems with this gamethe puzzles are sometimes things you would never think of some of his escapes from various traps etc are very much like mcgyver and took me a long time to piece them together but that may just be me for most people including me a guide may be a needed not option thing im far from stupid but some of the puzzles just arent at all obvious the controls at times can also be a problem it takes alot of time to move around many areas and can be a real pain running back and forth the almost constant loading times are also a problem whenever dialogue is going on the game is jerky same with movies and sometimes the smallest little scene needs a load timeto me this game shows why this genre of games will never be as popular as the gran turismos and resident evils if you have alot of patience and a lot of time this game may be for you but for me ill stick to gt for now at least rent before you buy
n is a simple game with very basic d graphics in no such manner does it utilize the full capibilities of the ds so what makes it a neat game to have especially on a road trip short to say that its simple you dont have to really put too much effort in it you just turn it on and play and if you do happen to turn your game off you wont lose muchthere are stages all together each episode has levels and there are episodes all together multiply that out and you get excluding online play which has about more saves happen after the completion of each episode and after so many episodes more episodes are unlocked no use of the sylus whatsoeveryou are basically a stick figure running through multiple obsticles in each stage there is a beacon you must reach in order to open up a door playing each level just to pass it is one thing but playing it to obtain every single gold piece is a whole nother thing even though its impossible to collect them all because there are at least two places that its not possible to get it because its suicide gold pieces give you a challenge but also help you unlock things not completely necessary things such as new character colors etc but theyre still something you can also pass levels to unlock it as well hence the unnecessary partits a good game to pick up and play really fast like tetris or one of those classic arcade games simple yet funthere are some very challenging levels but overall most of the levels are not too incredibly hard unless you want to collect all the gold pieces which makes each level a lot hardergood graphics heck no awesome music collection whistles and walks away dont expect any best game of the year award but its a very neat game to play on the go since you dont really worry too much on saving and more on quick playi actually found it quite more amusing than many ds games out there should you get it yeah better than tetris and all those overused junk that nintendo continuously recycles
who would have thought that we would have a lego marvel game i got excited for this one first off this game is beautiful the graphics are good for a game the amount of characters is amazing with over lego figures to collect the flight controls are a little hard to learn but it gets just a little easier story is awesome and the deadpool levels redbrick levels are crazy fun vehicles are great but i wish there where a few more boats there are only two i would definitely recommend this game to a lego fan or marvel fan or a combination lego marvel fan
nough people complained and microsoft responded with the controller s a vast improvement over the original xbox controller its size button placement and comfort are all exactly as they should be ive amassed an impressive collection of consoles and controllers over the years and this one just might be my favorite though the psxps controllers are nearly perfectgamers who have had the xbox a long time and are used to the old controller or gamers who have hands the size of a yetis might want to stick with what theyve got however also note that the old controller is being phased out in favor of this new one so if you prefer the old ones now is the time to get more if youll ever want them
i really dont think this game is as bad as people make it out to be keep in mind im a huge thor fan so im sure that helped me enjoy the game more but if a game totally sucks i almost always end up putting it down and i actually completed this game honestly the only complaint i really have about the game is the graphics yes theyre really not that great but im more into gameplay and story anyway so if graphics arent that important to you then you may like it if i have to compare the game to anything itd have to be god of war alot of people say this game is a gow rip off and that may be the case but is that really a bad thing for those people who like collecting things as a bonus you can collect hammers valknuts lightning runes and costume upgrades throughout the game to upgrade health mana etc though some of them you can only collect playing the game on hardanyways i wrote this review for people who love thor and comics but arent sure if theyll like this game i enjoyed the game enough to keep playing it even after i beat it and i kept in mind from the start that i was playing a marvel movie game and i knew that most of them arent going to be amazing but compared to the iron man games id say its pretty decentif thor is your favorite comic book character or youre a huge comic book fan then i say give it a shot but personally i probably wouldnt spend more than bucks on it theres plenty of better games out there but i expect most comicmovie games to be horrible so this game definitely wasnt anywhere near as bad as i expected it to be on a scale of id probably give it a ive played alot better yeah but ive definitely played alot worse
t this point in the series theres not much i can say that i havent said before robot masters weapons gained from them the assistance of rush and so on and so forth personally i liked the weapons star man napalm man and crystal man left behind one new thing is the mega tank energy tanks only filled health but the mtank filled the energy for health and all weapons which comes handy in a pinch especially if youre fighting the final bossesproto man is the bad guy here but like mm theres a twist to the ending if youve played mm then it shouldnt surprise you as the twists are similar just with a different character overall a fairly enjoyable mega man title
i have teenaged kids who love this game before it came out they were a bit afraid that itd be too similar to the others in the same series but once they played it they were hooked the graphics are really great the scenery is breathtaking and the story line is entertaining and fun i wouldnt recommend it to younger players since there is some violence involved but i think older teenagers will enjoy it i cant comment on specific technical details because i dont know too much about all that stuff but my kids do and they really love this game as do many of their friends
ive only had this game for a day so far but i played it for hours now if you want to read all those review on the other sites youre gon na think im mad ill tell you right now some of those critics arent particularly loving the game their complaints about it however are ridiculous if it was that bad a game then i wouldnt have so many people playing it nonstop out of my friendslist of peoplei enjoyed ffxii in some ways and in many i disliked it the battle system was pretty good the environments were detailed i just had a great dislike of the story it was just very confusing the characters werent all that great either and thats what people are saying about wkc only difference is those same people loved ffwkc basic premise is that the main character leonard is a typical working class guy he has a run in with princess cisna and in an attempt to rescue her he gains the ability to summon a white knight to aid him in battle the story may have been done before but for me im just glad it makes sense but i think my favorite thing about this game has to be the online building my own town then letting others come to it there are a lot of people playing online too i opened my town earlier and all of a sudden it was full so full in fact i had to make another room in my hometown to invite my friends to it may sound bad but there is the option to password each room you make in your town the rooms are basically lobbies which can hold people and groups of can go on quests together it really gives the game its mmo feel while ff felt like an mmo wkc really expands on that you can actually take the fun online with your friends and even people you dont knowhonestly if youre iffy on the game after all the reviews then you should rent it i could go on and on about all of the awesome things in the game but most of it can be discovered in other reviews and previews of the game it typically gets its low rating cause of the single player so if youre not intending to play this title online rent it if youre unsure and want to play it online rent it but i can say that this game was worth the price with all the content in it

we have a fairly new computer with windows xp and a graphics card which meets the specs listed on the box and we can not get this game to run it installs but then when you ask it to run it flashes for a second and then dies after doing some extensive research this is a common problem some people have managed to tweak their computers in order to get this game to run we have not id seriously advise against wasting any money on this game even with the latest patches we still can not get it to run this is apparently what is happening generally when attempting to adapt xboxplaystation games for the computer they are sent out there with a lot of bugs good luck
kay i admit that i am a little late to the elder scrolls and skyrim party i finally got my xbox last spring and i started with kingdoms of amalur and dragon age origins because i have always liked medieval rpg style games i suspected that skyrim was probably going to be the best one for me because of all the star reviews and also because in addition to rpgs i also just like vikings dragons nordic lore etc in generalwow skyrim is everything i wanted and more it actually exceeded my high expectations and reset what i thought a videogame could do i had read the star reviews but was not sure it could live up to the hype it didthe graphics are great and you can get lost for days in a beautiful nordic mountain world the first dragon i fought was the single coolest battle ive ever had on a video game i got chills it was so cool the character leveling is both complex and intuitive you really do level up exactly those talents you use the most im also enjoying the alchemy smithing and enchanting activities i love walking new tracts of wilderness ive never seen before looking for plants to harvest for alchemy potions while hunting beasts and discovering new cavesdungeonslore along the way the archery is really enjoyable too you can stalk prey such as cave bears or giants with stealth and arrows i find that im gravitating toward an archerystealthmage build with emphasis on destruction and conjuration spells there are a thousand different ways you could take a character though im level and in love with this gameif you are wondering whether you should play oblivion or any other game for that matter first dont worry about it get this version and jump right into skyrim this is the best you install disc on your xbox first then use disc when you play the game it comes preloaded with dawnguard and all of the other skyrim expansions already set for your game so your first playthrough will enclude the entire gamut of skyrim locations spells monsters lore etc dont even bother with other versions this one is the whole enchiladaas much as i loved the combat and graphics of amalur and the characters and plot of dragon age origins i am loving the entirety of skyrim so much more i love every hour spent on this game and i find myself thinking about it when not playing get this one it is the best
secret rings is a nice wii game the controls arent the best but theyre at least reliable of the time you use the the games fun but its story structure is not the best out there because theyre using still frames to represent a book style theme the voice acting is defenatly not one of sonics best in the adventure mode you unlock ablilities to help sonic you can also unlock up to mini games though theyre mostly boring but some are ok at least sega thinking outside the normal stuff this is an good sonic game but it defenatly needs some work rent it first
i played fallout for many many hours more then i ever want to admit but i wanted to get the goty because i wanted to continue my original adventure and it was great i spend over hours looking for everything in all the dlc and thats whats great the disc though seems to be messed up or something cause at times it will work perfectly and at other times it would not load up at all i tried it at my friends house as well with an xbox slim and it happened to him as well but it hasnt happened since which is great
i like this game but this game is mainly for those of you that like racing games as well as rpgsafter jak and daxter jak and jak i have no idea where this game came from a racing game thrown into an rpg series unlike me most rpgjak players at least everyone that i know dont like racing games all that much so jak x seemed a little strange to me the story doesnt suit the type of game very well racing with a cutscene thrown in here and there but overall it is a good gameone thing i like is the weapons i prefer combat racing over regular racing so guns and weapons make this game more enjoyable there is also a large range of games aside from circuit races games such as sport hunt artifact race like in jak deathrace deathmatch and rush hour can be played as wellthe onlinemultiplayer is fun but when you play multiplayer the stats of the cars go down to what they were when you first got them all that upgrading is useless for online play not the best online game but still funall in all jak x is a good game but not my favorite or what i would expect from the jak series
jet grind radio is yet another impressively creative title to come out of sega which is why im so fond of sega and definitely rates as a successthe concept is simple you skate around towns tagging spraypainting certain objects while evading police officers police dogs rockets from helicopters and other baddies the animation style is really what cements the experience as being something out of the ordinary though dubbed quotcelshadingquot the end result is something that looks very much like a cartoon its really beautiful to watch as well as playthe gameplay is fun but has some problems the first which likely everyone has addressed is camera control there are unused buttons on the controller and the developers still decided for some unknown reason to double up controls its annoying but you learn to live with it the other issue that bugs me is that youre constantly on the run from police with no real defense other than fleeingone other problem i have is with the menu system when you boot up youre given the choice of starting a new game playing a tutorial or loading an existing file however once you have a game in play through creating a new game or loading you have to reboot the system to load another this is really a patently ridiculous feature and particularly annoying if you like alternating w a friend but keep seperate game filesone other note i should make is that the worlds may seem smaller than they were described by other reviewers at first i was pretty aggravated and disappointed for a while until i got far enough that i was actually given the opportunity to skate more or less freely without worry of harassment by police etc its a bit into the game but worth noting if you get discouragedall in all jet grind radio is still a fantastic game and definitely a game to get for the dreamcast there are minor points that really should have been taken care of but other than that a solid effort
forget the remake ofbionic commando this is the real deal bionic commando for the nes is an excellent game with some inventive bit gameplay mechanics the story is simple it follows radd spencer as he goes to rescue super joe another commando who was captured by bad guys radd is equipped with numerous weapons and a bionic arm to help him rescue joe and defeat the bad guys a short and sweet nes backstory in the vein of good olcontrathe game is unique in the fact that you can not jump huh you have to be able to jump to get around the levels right not necessarily in bionic commando your bionic arm acts like a grappling hook and you use it to climb platforms swing across spike and fire pits and to pull down out of reach enemies its an interesting game dynamic and at a time when every other game character could jump it was almost revolutionary the available weapons are standard youve got a rifle a wide gun a way gun a rocket launcher and a bazooka i think the rocket launcher is the best choice for almost every level there are also a bunch of items you can find but none of them are that effective except for the bullet proof vestthe map screen is also interesting instead of progressing linearly to the next level youre in a helicopter and can choose what area you want to go to next occasionally running into enemy forces and battling them in between levels it is an original concept that was refreshing at a time when most games went straight from point a to point b the game is bright and colorful as well with each level having a different color scheme and enemies the enemies vary from soldiers with guns and enemy bionic commandos to sentient slime and giant supercomputers the human enemies you kill drop bullets which when enough are collected your life bar extends one point you start with three energy points and can work your way to a total of eightthe controls are tight and work surprisingly well using the arm takes some getting used to but the game takes that into consideration by making each level depend more on the bionic arm as you progress by the time you get to levels and youll be a master at swinging grappling and landingall in all a really good addition to the nes library that has some unique bit innovations and is a lot of fun to play a must own for anyone with a nintendo
this game is an instant classic with brilliant graphics environments gameplay and story blends jrpg and steampunk elements into a seamless experience that comes along once every few years characters are interesting tons of customization from weapons to clothing and the world is vast and full of areas to explore combat is unique and there is a bit of a learning curve but once you get the hang of it youll enjoy the depth of strategy involved this is a rich complex game with many layers that will suck you in and make you glad you own it for some reason its pretty hard to find in retail stores but grab it if you see it one of if not the years bestthe one major flaw it has already been mentioned how complex the combat is managing so many moving parts is pretty much impossible youve got scratch points direct damage points physical damage and another half dozen different types of damage that you have to constantly be aware of if any one character falls too low they all go into critical mode that means none of them can do much more than cower and take more damage often leading to mission failure just to demonstrate how complicated the combat isive often thought the battle was going well for me until i found myself unexpectedly in critical conditionseemingly without rhyme or reason probably because i still dont understand everything thats factoring into my hp and probably never will very punishing very unforgiving combat
this game is supposed to be the second part to frontlines which by the way still kicks ass unlike its counter parthomefront is a complete total let down every detail about frontlines is way better the graphics storyline online game play etc homefront falls short on every aspect including the length of the game the graphics alone would say stay far from this game i havent seen these graphics since the game of which u all know are completely outdated frontlines is an older game and still has sharper crisp graphics the worst part for me was waiting so long for this title to surface then buying it only to be shot down like a duck in hunting season thank goodness i didnt get ranked for much money only paid dollars for this worthless title for those who have this gamegoodluck trying to get some good money or a trade for it while its so called stockmarket value is still in play i got dollars back from a local video game shop took only a dollar loss and used my money for a better game
i purchased this game day one of the console launch and figure itd give it a few months before a review so heres my summary great graphics the gameplay gets a bit repetitive and ive had some decent amount of issues with online at times but for the most part it works pretty good i purchased the season pass which so far has not been worth it but hopefully that changes soon it reminds me of a mixture between god of war and any other hack and slash gamegreat visuals though that was one of the main reasons i bought it and it doesnt disappoint in that category
this review is for the game combo pack for the xbox the pack included with select xbox consoles the games included are pure atv racing and lego batman first i will review pure and then lego batmanpure is an interesting game it is fun to pass the time but definitely doesnt have enough depth to keep my interests in the game for very long it is loosely based around the forza racing series where you own a of atv vehicles you can build upgrade and customize to your hearts content using these atvs you can race is single races tournaments and time trials the graphics are great and the racing is fun with complex courses however you can not choose more than a few precreated racers to race with in addition there is no option to listen to custom soundtracks a seemingly obvious no brainer for a racing game overall the game is fun but doesnt have a great replay valuelego batman has become one of my favorite games for xbox like other legobased video games it is a thirdperson actionadventure game based on lego toys in lego batman the player first plays as batman adventuring through gotham city to save citizens from evil schemes created by the riddler the joker and the penguin after the player completes a mission heshe can go back and play through the levels as a different character who all have different abilities it is only this way that a player can truly complete the game on top of that the player can also play through the same missions as villians in the game further developing the story and depth to the game overall this game is great and has huge replay value i give this game stars and would recommend it to any video game or lego fan
this is the game i have been looking for its well polished with massive amounts of content each class is unique and simply fun to play by chance you just want a new mmo that expands and expands its world while you play you should check it out something i am a fan of is not having many load screens like ff games what i do like are massive environments to play around in this game accomplishes that goal for me if you enjoy the basic mechanics to mmos then you would be missing out if you dont check this outive played many mmos going back all the way to uo played about years with wow but needed something different and havent played that in probably years this does it for me
ything the others say about this game is accurate it is a driving simulator your car never gets scratched the ai in the game is lacking etc so if you want a driving simulator buy this game because it is fun to compare the cars on the race tracks there is at least one race that seems impossible and this impossible requirement brings the fun level down i dont mind trying times to win a race which requires me to really examine every turn but forcing me to drive that suzuki cappuccino in a race against better cars starting from the th position gim me a break challenging i dont mind next to impossible is just too disappointing to be fun
simply put this game is a travesty star ocean s story or script were not masterworks by any measure but they are light years ahead of so compound the horrible story script with some really horrid decisions concerning the voice acting and you simply get a bad game a role playing game needs a good story the vehicle for that story is to some degree the voice acting and to a very large degree the script if both of those elements are bad as they are here then everything else falls apartthe battle system is fun for awhile but like all so games its extremely breakable so is even more breakable than so its really all about just picking your favorite skill and spamming it to death all of the crafting elements from previous so games are thereive given up on games because they are too hard but its very rare for me to give up on a game especially an rpg because of how bad it was i gave up on so because of how bad it is
k i really love this game there r a few things that take from the experience tho that would b mixing mini games that cater more to tween girls in w a fun game not meant for tween girls or any young kids hence the mature rating this was the st yakuza game i played i had such a ball until the stupid hostess mission w whats her name girl u r testing for loan ppl who enjoy these games generally have zero interest in picking hair dos nails makeup outfits for hostesses especially when picking sensible options for each category is actually the wrong choice answers which give u best points r not at all what u would pick to match each category either way these mini games suck so does massage mini game stupid theyre much like what ud find if u went to online game site picked games for girls dress up is not what yakuza game fans or buyers want to playmelee is a blast open world is fun story is great just took off the star gave it for the mini games that dont match w theme or gameplay i get the whole hostess club thing just think the game involved w that part is a drag rest is fun if u can forgive the parts that dont fit game ull enjoy the rest
capcom yet again brings its winning formula of having excellent d fighters look d to a gorgeous apex in super street fighter iv easily the best animated fighting game ive ever seen even moreso than the outstanding blazblue ssfiv is the best fighting game in history and one that you can not really do much to topthe engine is very similar to the outstanding sfiv with some of the same glitches and exploits zangiefs spinning lariat is still able to win almost every single fight with virtually no problems on all difficulties its hard to really discuss the game because in the end it is a fighting game there is no plot here there is just animation and timing both of which are amongst the greatest that this console generation has ever seen the character choices are vast and not the usual palateswap players as in other fighters such as tekken vihaving played minimal onlinei am terrible at the game admittedlyi can not really say if the games occasional janky online code has been fixed the few bouts i had didn t experience lag but i am also not good enough to notice the lag that a high level player would notice its a bit embarrassing to admit that youre not good enough to notice that theres a problem but that is the boat we are inif you like fighting games at all i recommend this highly even if you dont adore fighting games its playable but dont waste your time with playing online you will get viciously obliterated and that isnt fun for anybody
panzers contrary to some opinions here is not a bad game its definitely one of the better more detailed wwii rts ive played all the demos so far and even got some time with a friends german copyits got some solid gameplay i couldnt find any bugs and the units are nicely balanced and unlike most other rts of late there are no pathing issues its nice to issue a movement command and watch the infantry and tanks actually follow a sensible route from point a to point b the lack of good pathing drove me crazy in heroes of wwiigraphically its pretty tasty even zoommed in tight unit markings are clear and truetolifeid say go for this over heroes of wwii it wont tax your pc nearly as much yet it looks just as good and the gameplay is more fun a lot less micromanagement
i picked my a couple days ago and i couldnt be happier i got it with some grad money and ill probably take it to college with me i play it on a inch tv in my room and it still looks bangin so all the hype about having to have hd is bologna i picked up farcry hitman nhl k and condemned with my system and it pretty friggin sweetall of the different little features with the system really help it stick out having the ability to download game demos videos tv episodes etc over xbox live is pretty crazyall in all its a good by and i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good video game system with a decent array of games
this is the very best handheld ive ever had and i had my share the new technology that nintendo uses with the ds is awesome the touch screen is the best the graphics are dynamite and the sound coming from the ds is surround you can even talk to someone else from a distance using pictochat you write a message on the touch screen hit enter and another person using a ds in the area has your message in a second the only thing with the pictochat is your message is not private anyone in the area that is playing with the ds will get your message overall this system is a just great if you have just lying around pick up a nintendo ds
this game has the atmosphere of aoe series for the most partsit really is nicethe main theme really takes you to the time when you first played aoeif you have lolwhen i first downloaded the demo and ran this game i just couldnt help but to listen to the main theme over times or so because it was just so touchingand the gameplay wasnt too shabby eitherbut something is lacking in the game and i dont feel like payin bucks for this game ya know i wonder whyi really enjoyed aoe it is still probably one of my favorite games of all time and aoe was definitely one of the better games ive playedaom was a nice addition to my ensemble studios collection and i thought it had the best presentation compared to the other ensemble productsgood graphics nice introblah blahbut strangely i dont have the urge to buy this game like i did when i played the demo of aommaybe its because the game betrayed the series and moved on to the battle for the newly found continent of americamaybe its because the gameplay isnt as satisfying as the other gamessadly im deciding to skip this game i dont care how good the game physic is or how amazing the graphics is what i care about is a game that i can play and feel like i didnt waste my timesince that is the case with me these days with most gamesmaybe the rts genre is really dying like many people saya new inspiration is needed for the game makers to make this genre great againwith westwood gone and ensemble not as striking as they used to beof course its my opinion im going to give my one last hope for blizzard to see if they can make starcraft or warcraft greatyah and if youre reading this review peeps at ensemble yall should know that people still play starcraft when the game doesnt have the realistic physic or d graphicsa year old game with d graphics with only colors supported still is the best rts game to date
super mario galaxy was one of my first wii games when i first played the game i thought the game was absolutly spactular i was blown away with the graphicsmusicand gameplay most of marios moves in this game are brought back from super mario which is cool the people who played mario will be very familiar with the gameplay i think every song in the game goes wonderful with every enviorment some of the music in the game are remixed tunes of past mario games like super mario bros and mario all of the music sounds amazing my favorite music is the battle rock music that is all i really have to say about the game its a really good game and you should definetly pick it up
if you liked nocturne make sure you pick this one up it has a lot of similarities and some improvements i really like how the new smt games have a search function for the demon fusion its all i would need the internet for while playing the game and sometimes i would inadvertently spoil something in the game when looking up a demon combination if you have played any of the other shin megami tensei including persona series games and enjoyed them definitely give this a tryspeaking of nocturne if anyone from sony reads this i will buy a vita just for nocturne if you port it to the vita id really like to see that game ported to a handheld console
its also very hard to get a hold of this is the kind of game you hope for with the ds something fun and out of the ordinary the bejweled aspect can get annoying at times but it just means you need to pay attention the good part is that if you need to you can put this down at any moment and pick up again without oh and to that effect losing a battle still gets you something what a concept additionally there are choices you have to make in the game that affect the ending and playstyle to give you some flavor its very addicting challenging and worth the bargain basement priceone note in case amazon copies this over to the psp version there is a bug currently known that you get no credit for your companions its only a small help but still could be a distractor for some on the companys site they havent mention if they will have a fix in newer version of the game or not
i am new to the gow series and i must say i am extremely happy with this game so far i have almost beaten the first game and i cant wait to play the second now im even jonsing for part three in march there are a couple parts that are really frustrating like some of the puzzles where you find yourself online getting hints but overall i am really enjoying it and the graphics are top notch i have never seen either game on a ps so for me this is it but it looks great part looks like it could have been made for the ps so i cant wait to see what these guys do with part anyway both of these great games on one disc in hd is a super deal and one that any action gaming fan should not pass up especially if you have never played gow before like me then this is a great intro to the series have fun
just got to chapter on the single campaign after seeing what ive seen and just went through at the start of chapter its a really good game first of all its a great story different than what weve seen over the years action is intense and yes its a mix of gears of war and modern warfare but yet feels fresh and different give this game a five for the all around package of single palyer campaign have not played multiplayer yet maybe im oldschool but a game has to pull me in with the characters and story first after all thats what got me to switch from the playstation to the original xbox so many years ago halo this game is worth checking out be it new or usedadding on to my previous review as i just beat the game simply incredible story that makes you feel like you are losing your mind a mix of apocolypse now gears of war modern warfare and psycho great game with plenty of action blood and more
i bought this game because if there is one thing i could expect it was that the ea nhl series was always getting better i was wrong this time ea took a step back on thisps revived madden it should have done the same for the nhl series the commentary is bad the rosters i wont even go there shame on you the ai ea has promised better ai every year and i still score at will rosters need to be better updated for the franchise mode needs to be more and so do the custome teams this year i recomend segas nhl k and i never thought i would say that
i got this product for my kids ages and they both love toy story while ive let them borrow the game now and then i have yet to give it to them fulltime i love this game and am having a blast the story in the game is great and pretty much follows along with the movie of course there is a lot of stuff in the game that isnt in the movie an vice versa so dont come into the game thinking it is going to be a for image of what you saw in the cinema i think this makes the game even more of a ok so the story is told from the perspective of woody or buzz at different times you will play as one of these two characters woody plays very like while buzz is more about flying and zapping stuff with lasers sometimes youll be in and other times your adventure will take place in the fictional universe of the character such as being buzz and flying through space shooting asteroids and aliensas a nice little diversion for when you dont feel like doing the main story there is this is a very simplified tower defense type game and is a real blast to play as you advance through the story youll unlock more different maps for tower defensei highly recommend this title i havent played a ds game this is more fun or accessible for all age groups this game definitely deserves stars
this is a bonus a way overpriced but still a bonus basically this turns your ps into a tower making it sleeker and easier to place somewhere so that the ps takes up less room surprisingly enough it looks less stable than what it is mine has been through hell and the ps has never toppledis it worth it the verdict is yes but not at that price since this is a monopoly item for the ps then you will just have to splash out if you want it you do not get value for money but you do get a great addition to your ps
i still drag out my old doom games and play so i was excited to hear that doom iii was coming out technology seems to have left me in the dust in the mids i dont know what kind of graphics card etc my systems have but both computers are less than year old so i figured i would be able to play doom wrong somethings wrong the graphics are low resolution and the action is so slow that playing is a chore that i gave up on within a few hoursi think this is the last computer game ill buy apparently im too far behind in knowledge to buy a computer for gaming even though thats what i told the computer salesman i wanted guess ill go with xbox where you know the game has been tested and it will workvery disappointed and poorer
ninja gaiden has gorgeous graphics and lets your ninja character move from rural villages to the halls of a techno air shipyou play ryu a ninja whose father has entrusted him with a magic sword trouble soon erupts and you are fighting your way through a variety of landscapes encountering tougher and tougher bosses and building up your skills you pick up new weapons learn more moves and root out the masterminds behind the disturbancesthe game is very much like splinter cell with ninjas the graphics are really quite impressive with the flowing scarf and varied textures the shadows and reflections are right on the body shapes and movements are quite impressive to look atstealth is a part of your job being a ninja but there is a lot of fighting as well you have a wide array of moves to use in taking down your enemy includindg fun walljumps a la prince of persia you pick up items along the way to move you along your quest its relatively onedirectional so you dont end up lost in a giant map wondering what to do nextthis game is not an easy game so prepare yourself for a lot of work in learning how to use your skills well even the easiest bosses take some time to get through this will be a good challenge for your gameplaying abilities i see this as a very good thing i dislike games that i just breeze through without any effortrecommended if youre up for a fighting adventure challenge and dont mind a few heads being cut off along the way also recommended if youre patient and want to build up your gaming skills this wouldnt be a good game to rent for just a weekend its a game that can keep you busy for weeks if not months
this game is about sneaking around in the dark stealing stuff and being patient probably wont be fun for people who like run and gun or folks who are expecting it to be assassins creedits its own gameyeah its linerin the same sense that many story based games are liner not everything needs to be some open world thief is a story and you are part of itif you are an adult gamer who likes a good challenge and has patience and imagination enough to have a good time while not going in guns blazing to every game you play then you will have fun im not a guy who likes to replay missions to up my score but i will say there is plenty of replay value here if you are that type of gamer i got it from gamefly did not buy it due to worries about the low reviews and have to say that if i did buy it i wouldnt be upset however you get your hands on a copy its fun for what its worth i have probably played for around hours and am only on chapter not going super fast but not super slow
you are driving through dire grove when your car breaks down in a snowstorm while looking for shelter you come across an abandoned car with a camcorder inside you soon find out the four teenagers are missing and something supernatural may have gotten a hold of them your job is to find the missing teenagers free them and stop the kidnapper from acting is another excellent hidden objectpuzzle game in the mystery case files series each game in the series improves on the prior entries and is one of the best in the series it is an interesting mix of live action seen through videotapes you find throughout the game and animation and there are some genuinely scary graphics in the game the storyline is a good one well written and developed and having the students appear in live action footage only adds to the urgency of the game there is a nice atmospheric feel to the game not only because of the graphics but the background music while some hidden object games fizzle at the end the conclusion of this game was just as well done as the rest of the is untimed as it should be so you can take your time soak in the atmosphere and try to solve various puzzles pay attention to virtually everything in the game because you may need to use it later in the game the hidden object games can be difficult but you have ample hints the hint button refreshes pretty quickly if you click too fast your cursor freezes for a moment literally nice touch there are a few mini games none are too difficult but they can be tedious these games can be skipped if you wish there is a lot of revisiting locations in the game sometimes you find a hidden object game in a location that didnt have one earlier and a map of dire grove would have been a nice addition although there is no map there is a logbook that proves especially helpful close to the end of the game there is also an inventory bar that i referenced several times the game is sometimes easy and sometimes hard towards the end i had to reference a walkthrough because i was stumped my total playing time was approximately hours although it felt isnt perfect and has a few odd glitches my logbook repeated the same page three times and the game froze a few times but for the most part it is a good challenging game and another winner in the mystery case files series
this pan feels great and looks good the thing we love the most is that the ozeri line is nonstick and completely free of ptfe and pfoa all the harmful chemicals and materials found in most other nonstick cookware we have thrown out all our old pans with the chemical laden coatings after finding that nothing stuck to these pans when we followed the manufacturers instructions of preconditioning the pan with a few drops of oil everything turned over very easily and the pan was easy to clean we bought this pan for larger meals and the chicken and veggies we cooked in it first was great we have found that it heats evenly and quickly on our ceramic smooth top stove and it really is a pleasure to use while looking for safe options in nonstick cookware we found that pans of this quality in retail stores were way higher in price and didnt feel half as solid as the ozeri pans we purchased
yes i have of the large containers several of the mediun and of the small i bought the oval red and white checked labels put them on the side so they look nice in my pantry it looks like i need more since i just bought a lb of arrowrootcalgon take me away before i buy any more i still love my flour keep but dont drop it on a mexican tile floor it will split yikes im purchasing another flour keeper me bad i would like to see them put indentations on both sides so i can get a better grip on it even using both hands
have now had calphalon katanas for almost two years may initial reactions was what great looking knives but ive found the beauty is somewhat skin deep the knives are initially very sharp but they dont hold a edge as well as my much more expensive shun knives but my biggest gripe is that if they are not cleaned and dried right away they tend to rust most annoying ive been very careful about this but when others use them the problems persists and if the rust develops close to the edge the edge tends to pit this can and has been corrected but i dont know why it should be a problem i care these knives the same as i do with a few shun knives that i have and i dont have the same problem with them probably a different type of steel used but both have the beautiful layered blades the shuns are to times more expensive than the calphalon katanas they are sharper and stay sharper longer and are a little lighter the kantanas are a good value for what you get the shuns are an investment
i have a small kitchen and so i am always looking for items that will do doubleduty working glasses do that extremely well they are wellweighted hard to topple easy grip and come in sizes when you add on the lids they make perfect food storage containers the small size is perfect for making puddings and put the lid on to store and stack in fridge did i mention they stack really well with the lids on also dips leftovers cut up veggies etc i use the large ones for storing maple syrup leftover juice cut up celery sticks herbs etc and theyre great for making refrigerator pickle spears this set of lids fits either size of glass so one set of lids fits both types they fit snug but as other reviewers say they may not be watertight if held upside down with liquid in them while transporting but i havent had an issue with that and i kinda like that its not so tight a fit that you have to really work at it to get them off oh and you can freeze in them too we dont always keep milk in the house now that the kids are grown so ill measure out a cup put in the glass with the lid on and store in the freezer for the times im cooking and need milk but dont have fresh on hand nice to be able to buy the lids separately as you lose or wear them out the glasses seem like they will last forever great product
i am somewhat new to baking and have begun to make my own cakes from scratch after experimenting with various recipes and pans i bought this one i was amazed by it i have never tried or even heard of anodized aluminum but after doing some research i found that it is supposed to be higher quality than most pans and have even heat distribution for the best baking results the cakes i made turned out wonderfully and kept their shape i only bought one pan and so to make a layer cake i had to wash it out right away to bake the second layer the pan was very hot but the instant i put it under cool water the entire thing was cold definitely conducts heat differently than regular pans very happy with the purchase
i love these knives the weight of the blade is just right and the handle gives me a comfortable grip i also think the height of the knife is perfect for when i chop and dice some are not as and i find that i have to work hard rocking it back and forth calphalon they seemed decently sharp and they sliced through different types of food with ease im not saying they are the best knives but for what i use them for regular everyday home cooking they are great for the price which is why i gave it five stars i always wash my knives and dry them after use and store them right back in the case i am thoroughly happy with them and the bamboo case is very nice
i have an older cuisinart ice cream machine that i had stopped using long ago because the results just werent worth the effort but i read some reviews for this machine and it impressed me so i checked it out further and when i saw it on sale i ordered it i just finished my first batch the peanut butter cup ice cream straight out of the furnished recipe booklet except i used soy milk and splenda instead of sugari was surprised by how noisy it was i dont remember the old machine making that much noise but that could just be my bad memory a few good hints to knowthe first time the machine stops turn it off for about thirty seconds then turn it back on mine ran for an additional five minutes i learned this from my using old machine also as soon as your freezer finishes and youve served your guests empty the rest of the bowl into a plastic container for the freezer and immediately wash the bowl and put it back in the freezer the sooner you get the bowl back in the freezer the better it takes it longer to freeze you dont want to leave it out overnight if you plan on making another batch the next day but back to tonights ice cream it was wonderful the icebc made a much firmer ice cream than my old cuisinart did the candy pieces were well distributed throughout the ice cream something the old machine was terrible at the sides of the bowl had plain ice cream stuck to it without any chocolate pieces so the dog got some too he seemed to think it was pretty great too
cuisinart h chefs classic stainless inch stirfry pan with helper handle and glass coverbeautiful wok and lid set lid is very fragil slid from top of wok to shelf of cabinet less than inches and shattered in hundreds of pieces of glass this is not safety glass it shattered all over cabinet shelf and all over the kitchen floor we swept several times and had to vacuum up many invisible fragments we could hear them going into vacuum i am replacing item that broke when we were at friends house for weekend amazon prime will take up to weeks for delivery even with prime from amazon why does it take weeks just to send this product from amazon warehouse and another week to deliver it via day prime delivery from amazon ordered jan and delivery up to feb via amazon prime
this lodge is a decent pan though it has some issues like other reviewers i found that the initial black coating was uneven or applied weirdly in some areas secondly the interior of the pan is way too rough to be truly nonstick the idea of nonstick cast iron comes from the interior finish being smooth and seasoned ive felt lodge pans wherever i go and they are all very rough on the interior i took the roughness down with grit then grit sandpaper then seasoned it twice and now its easy to use and works well but this took me over two hours to sand alonein the end id opt for a vintage turn of the century pan like a wagner on ebayyoull pay a bit more for it but it will be truly nonstick and youll most likely be eating off a pan that cooked a meal for some burly pioneer dude
im not that thrilled with this fan the one i bought for half the price is not as pretty but it seems to work much better this one is just as loud as the pedestal fan and they both have remotes it works but im a bit disappointed i had wanted a nicer looking one for the diningkitchen area where most of our company congregates but soon switched out the two fans and put the pedestal out it may not look as good but it does the best job this fan is not quiet you will definitely have to turn the tv up and youll have to get used to the noise its just annoying and id send it back and just get another pedestal but i hate having to repack and go thru all the hubaloo to do it if youre thinking about this one id recommend you keep looking and if youre more interested in cooling than in beauty get the lasko pedestal fan it will freeze you out
it is too hard to use when using a blanket one needs an oversized blanket to cover it and it is difficult to adjust the blanket over the pillow it does have a crease near the middle section that the stuffing migrated to other areas i find it to be wonderful to lean against but if you are not alone in a large bed then it is too large for the bed it is like having a rd person in the bed with you and your significant otheri dont like the curve on the end as i like the pillow i have that is for side sleeping the curve is now placed near the foot of the bed and makes it especially difficult to arrange with a blanketif you are a side sleeper and are buying it as i did to hold in front of you which is supposed to be good for shoulder problems someone forgot that when you sleep your arms relax and release the pillow which then falls onto the floori do like it for putting behind me when i read or watch tv in bed

we are using the stainless steel oxo set oxo good grips measuring cups stainless steel we got for our wedding nine years ago and they drive me nuts almost every time i use them since the handles are not nearly strong enough and constantly bend but i just couldnt see spending the money to replace them until i saw these in williams sonoma and felt them and saw just how sturdy they really are no they wont stack perfectly because of the handles which are bolted to the cup but i can overlook that these are definitely quality and meant to last and fyithey are a lot cheaper at williams sonoma
i got one of these ice cream makers as a christmas gift and its been fantastic i was careful before requesting it to check the temperature of my freezer if your freezer doesnt maintain a temperature of between degrees fahrenheit your ice cream probably wont turn out that well mine stays at a chilly zero degrees and ive been amazed at how quickly this machine makes great frozen desserts ive made the fullfat ice creams a couple of sherbets and frozen yogurt everything froze quickly and evenly and came out with fantastic texture and flavor its been a great gift i keep the bowl in the freezer wrapped in a plastic bag and filled with frozen vegetables so its always ready to go
up front i am not reviewing the set what i am reviewing is the quality of lock locki use them for storage at home flour sugar brown sugar confectioners sugar although i must admit that when my sister said a name on the outside of the container the xxx sugar now bears the name bobi have smaller containers which are used for a variety of things including camping the butter container stayed happily in the cooler without leakingwith a modicum of care and even with some abuse this product will reward you with wonderful servicei plan to retire to michigan and am trying to get my boyfriend to transition things like pasta floursugar jiffy mix etc to ll containers as i get really tired of finding things in the containers in which these items are purchased threw out worth of food just a few weeks ago while visiting which would have been avoided if hed just used ll containerscannot say enough wonderful things about this product the only limit for their use is your imagination
this is not a fluffy pillow by any means if you are looking for that do not buy this the buckwheat inside is more than you are likely to need so remove some for adding in later whenever that may be needed by doing this you can adjust the support size of the pillowsomeone made a comment about the odor it is not the buckwheat that is the odor it is the pillow casing i recommend that you remove the buckwheat hulls into a plastic sack with a zip closure sew the seams of the pillow case again just to be sure it remains seam well then wash it and line dry it this should help to get rid of the sizing chemical odor from the case in our case it got rid of the odorafter the case is dried add back into it the amount you would like to use if you lay both on your side on your back at different times and you need support under your neck you may find it best to make the pillow thinner and then when you lay on your side then bunch up the pillow underneath your head as neededthe reasons for the star is the odor of the case and for it being sewn okay but not well i doubt it would stand up to a lot of washings without reinforcing the seamsdont expect a soft pillow it is not it is supportive not soft
this is a pretty impressive jewelry scale especially considering the price the build quality is very nice it has a solid feel to it overall and the flip open lid is thick and has a good hingei like that it runs on standard batteries aaa which are included once the included batteries die i can replace them with rechargeables which are easy to find in the aaa sizeusing it is very straightforward the four buttons while small are clearly marked as to function the digital display is backlit and easy to readit comes with a small metal cup to hold the items you want to weigh its thin but has a good overall design with a tab to pick it up and a spout for poring very small items it also includes a set of tweezers that are of surprisingly good quality stainless steel with sharp tips that meet perfectly at the end they are nearly as good as another pair of precision tweezers i have that cost almost as much as the scaleaccuracy seems spot on and the scale comes with reference weights for calibrationzero complaints this is a very wellbuild scale for home use while it probably wont meet the durability needs of a professional jeweler it fits my hobby needs perfectly and then some very highly recommend sample provided for review
i was not really expecting the fan to be as small as it is however i am sure the size was listed so its my own fault it does a pretty good job moving air into a back storage room to cool it during the evening hours i think its best suited for a small area like a small office frankly for my application i wish id spent the extra money and bought a larger unit but that doesnt alter fact that it does a decent job of moving air its not too noisy even on high at least as compared to other fans i have running it seems to be very sturdy and well made it has been running since it arrived and so far ive no problems
i bought these because it is similar in design as my mikasa utensil set it is not as heavy as the mikasa but at first glance it fits right inthe head is not big but round enough to get a good amount of soup on it and so far it is shinning and looking newi really like these spoons and dont regret buying themif you are looking for something with more weight to them then you might want to look for other options but if you dont mind that it is a bit thinner and lighter then this is a great buy for you
it was a toss up between the less expensive freezethecontainer type of ice cream maker this modelwe gambled on this one after one use we are not disappointed one scare when taking it out of the boxwe could not get the paddle off of the motor assembly to wash it before st use didnt want to break it by forcing it but after reading all the material we could find on it decided that it was just jammed on super tight from the factoryshipping after a really firm tug it did come off now slips on off correctly clean up was not a problem just be sure to measure the correct amount of ice cream mix into the container it will not overflow it is very quiet the recipe we madebens chocolate from the ben jerrys ice cream cookbook available amazon took about an hour to freeze then it was a custard consistency but delicious we probably stopped it prematurely will let it go a little longer next timeall in all so far so good worth the investment
nt can openers such a pain you have to have one around but they always fall short of expectations because theyre either too hard to use too hard to clean or in the case of the electric ones they just stop working until now this can opener is easy to use doesnt hurt my hand to crank and wont break down like my electric in fact since my electric one gets so messy after each use i just pull this one out of the drawer instead no sense wasting electricity even miniscule amounts when this can opener is so convenient and takes little or no muscle to use it was a bit spendy for a can opener but it should last a long time it is easy to clean but it doesnt even seem to get food on the blade like my electric one does the handles are nice and grippy typical oxo and it has a nice weight to it it appears to be well built and pretty sharp i will never waste my money on electric can openers again you can even use this one when the power goes out
this is a wonderful coffee maker we love love love how it keeps our coffee hot for a long time we find the coffee is just as hot and tastes just as fresh as when first brewed hours or even longer after brewing thats pretty amazing for us and its a big plus it brews pretty quickly and the coffee tastes very goodwe love the way we can just push one button to get our coffee another nice thing it doesnt drip at all after we get a cup of coffee and take the cup away we havent seen it drip onceits a pretty big machine it doesnt fit well under our cabinets but then most coffee makers dont for usit uses the basket type filters a couple times we did notice the coffee grounds in the filter came up high and over the filter edge after brewing when that happened we did find a few coffee grounds in our coffee but thats not the norm i may have just used too much coffee those times or too little not sure it hasnt happened for a while so its not a big deal for usits not really the best coffee maker if you only one of two cups the keurigs really seem to do that well one cup at a time but we usually brew around cups and it works well for usits not any easier to clean than a regular coffee maker but because the inside carafe is made out of metal theres no way to break it in the am i can clean it out with my eyes half shut and i dont have to worrywe have received many comments from guests that they love the look of the machine and think its an awesome coffee maker we love it too
i read all of the reviews before purchasing this brand but even then i was surprised being a newbie to cooking i assumed that it would grate in a course texture as that was what i was looking for so when it didnt mention that it only grate a fine texture i didnt think to ask my husband tried it first and wasnt impressed the handle worked fine except the texture of the chedder was so fine it clogged the output ive tried it on other occasions and even when taking the cheese straight from the fridge on pepperjack especially it would spin the cheese into a loose rope rather than spread evenly on the food i looked for a course drum to use instead but apparently oxo doesnt make one for this model i think ill have to break down and buy a different brand with a course drum option
this is a nifty little gadget that fits easily over any door and gives you an extra coat hook in addition it can be pulled out so that it gives you a multisection hook that you can hang multiple clothing items on with hangers its ideal for keeping your clothes neat while traveling or to give you some extra hanging space in your closet or anywhere youve got a doorits extremely simple to use and is very lightweight it would fit very easily into a little corner or unobtrusive spot in a suitcase or carryall im very happy with it i have had some problems with oxo products recently but this is a quality item that appears to be durable and the price isnt outrageoushighly recommended
it is a very nice looking humidor however the hygrometer does not work is not calibrated properly i tried to calibrate it without success after seasoning the humidor for weeks with a boveda kit i bought a digital hygrometer to measure humidity it tells me the humidity is at without even putting in the pod with water or any other source of humidity even with the lid open it says its at the hygrometer is working i did the salt test but somehow the humidor is keeping too much humidity i live in michigan and it is somewhat humid but still maybe in a few weeks it will get back to normal
i am stunned by the positive reviews of this frother this is my third frother the others are bodum and then a wand type which is pretty useless this is basically the same design as the bodum but on this one there is no opening or air hole at the top the lid goes all the way around with no air allowed to escape while frothing which i didnt realize until now is essential for proper air flow even with the milk below the allowable level it spurts out of the top and spills all over the place and yes i have tried holding the top securely in place i have tried slowing down the pumping action to a gentler pace but then it takes forever to create froth because of this i can only froth in the sink and sure enough after having this only a few weeks the glass broke from only a very light accidental tap against the side of the sinki have had my bodum glass frother for two yearsone time my husband slightly chipped the top but i was able to use a nail file to smooth it out and it was fine i bought this one only because it has a slightly larger capacity and i usually make coffee for twothe bodum was really only good for one cup for the amount of milk we like in our coffeebottom lineflawed design and very thin delicate glass
i have a large collection of very high quality kitchen knives i dont have time to find a professional knife sharpener and cart these over to himher but i can take the time occasionally to take all of my knives down and run them through this i warn you though the edge is sharp so once youve used it be careful yes the motor will grind to a halt if the knife angle is wrong or you apply too much pressure but i think this is a good thing i agree with most of the other buyers its a great product especially for the money
i already have thevictorinox fibrox inch chefs knife but my wife wanted a smaller chefs knife for herself she has smaller hands than me so i picked up this set she finds the chefs knife easier for her to use especially for precise work like trimming fat from chicken breasts etc we both like the two small paring knives and the kitchen scissors are very handy too i see that a few people have complained about their knife blocks being shoddy but ours looks just fine i really like how well the blades are crafted and im amazed at how light they are this is a very nice little set for anyone looking to get a good started set of knives
we wish listed a handful of pieces on here for our living room and took a few days to mull it over while they were all great we just kept coming back to this one so we finally gave in we just got it yesterday and hung it up immediately its sturdy yet light weight enough to be secure on two screws its really impressive in the x size the orange shades are a little brighter in person than the picture here suggests but that is not necessarily a drawback it looks fantastic looking forward to many years of enjoyment
i tried these on three different non porous surfaces after cleaning thoroughly with alcohol they or rather one would stay in place for about a minute or lessthen fall off again this happened on all three surfaces one of the surfaces was a ceramic tile in the bathroom if it wont stay on that then what will it stay on yes i made certain the wheel was opened and yes i pressed the cup against the surfaces while tightening but it just kept on falling off after less than a minuteif others are having good luck with this suction cup that is great but for me they are horrible returning them to amazon
this grill does work as advertised it cooks much better then the numerous george formans i had since college im now in a apartment in brooklyn with no back yard this grill does the job for my girlfriend and i it heats evenly and there isnt much smoke we both agreed that even for an apartment we should have purchased the slightly bigger sg model the only thing to be aware of is this grill cooks thin sliced pieces of meatfish i tried cooking a thicker lamb chop and it couldnt cook it i suspect its not a covered grill and therefore doesnt retain the heat for chicken breasts steak fish vegetables burgers and hotdogs this thing rocks closest thing to an outdoor grill ive seen indoors
coffee beans frequently jam in the feed bin and cause the grinder to the remedy is to hold the grinder in your hands while its operating and shake it when the beans jam also bean fragments can get in the seating track for the lid and prevent the safety mechanism from engaging leaving you wondering why your grinder isnt operating finally the grind button on ours decided to fall inside the case fortunately the button isnt actually attached to the grind switch so you can stick your little finger through the hole in the case and punch the switch to turn it on and all of this within months of purchase needless to say when this grinder finally dies we wont be buying another thats made by krups
i just recently bought one of these mugs from the local big box store for a few pennies less than the mug so far has been perfect for heating a whole can of soup for lunch i see from some of the other reviews that there is some confusion about how much this particular cup can hold as you probably can see from the photo the cup has a slightly sloped rim if you fill the cup to the bottom of the rim it will hold ounces if you fill it all the way to the top it holds ounces given that you are heating stuff up in the microwave i wouldnt recommend filling the cup to the top as it will most likely over flowim giving the cup four stars simply because of the stickers that came on it when i purchased it there is a massive on the plastic top and one on the side of the cup itself getting these off and cleaning off all the adhesive was a major undertaking i tried everything to remove the gummy adhesive eventually resorted to soaking the top in alcohol and even that didnt remove the gummy residue completely
yes i do love the convenience of my keurig i am a rabid coffee lover one problem with this machine is not enough coffee even the largest cup it makes is not as large a cup as id like it has helped me cut down on my coffee consumption which is probably a good thing coffee is expensive and ecologically i do have an issue with creating so much waste with these innocuous seeming little k cups out there cluttering up the landfills and not bio degrading so im a little torn about liking this concept at all the convenience can not be beaten it is hot although a little hotter could be good fresh tasting coffee in a very short time since im the only coffee drinker in my home it also cuts down on waste of coffee as i used to brew an entire pot drink half on one day and finish it off the nextbut there were many times i ended up throwing out leftover coffee fresh coffee every time is fairly irresistible when k cups are made to be biodegradable i think i will enjoy the pleasure of my keurig without the guilt i pacify the guilt by keeping an extremely low carbon footprint other than the keurig but admittedly it is an indulgence i cant resist and yes i have a reusable filternot as convenient as the k cups but more ecologically conscientious in good conscience im not sure i can recommend it for the ecological impact but i do love the convenience
the pictures online just do not do the kurv justice it is way more beautiful than that as a longtime owner of the kone i knew that the kurv would work perfectly and look fabulous but i had no idea how much i would fall in love with it first of all the color is so rich and vibrant and it matches my chocolate italian leather furniture precisely and with its glittery and shimmery illuminating appearance it has an almost calming effect too of course i leave mine out all the time because the kurv really does look like a chic vase or a fine piece of art or even a sculpture and i can not believe how durable and solid and strong and powerful this thing is it picks up crumbs pine needles dust lint glass anything you can think of i use it the most on my ceramic tile floors i also use it to spot clean on my area rugs before i do the big cleaning which also saves me time and saves on wear tear on my rugs but mostly i enjoy this item for its luster and shine and startling appearance and since the base has an indentation to hold the cord no one will ever be able to detect that its a handheld vacuum i purchased this from hsn recently on clearance they were less than amzons price and it truly is one of the very best cleaning products that i have gotten in a long long time i look forward to getting a brum next
i was thoroughly unimpressed when i first unboxed this little peeler although made of stainless steel it felt so lightweight and flimsy in my hand disgusted i tossed it in my kitchen gadget drawer and figured id give it a shot the next time i needed to peel veggies but i wasnt expecting mucha few days later i was making salad and needed to peel some cucumber so i grabbed this thing and wow what felt cheap and crummy in my hand suddenly felt like a lightweight and perfect peeling tool this peeler is perfectly balanced and so easy to use you can comfortably peel even the tiniest veggies without worrying about cutting yourself it is so much easier to control than a peeler with a handle an added plus is that the design protects the blade during storage and it takes up very little space in a drawermy husband tried it a few days ago on a bunch of potatoes and was amazed and how easy and quick it wasreally neat little tool and theyve definitely improved on this necessary kitchen gadget
nine months ago i received a single piece tatnall place setting from vine at the time i wasnt very impressed sturdy but nothing special about it the design looked a bit scribbly and the color seemed a bit too purple for what i was expectingmy husband wanted me to throw the set out since it didnt fit nicely with our old plates but i hung onto them because i liked them the dinner plate feels great nicely balanced and the salad plate is perfectly sized imo the bowl is nice too i prefer it to ones with tapered sides theyve been great for everyday use i found that i actually preferred them to pur old stuff so imagine my delight when i received a whole piece dinnerware set its really been wonderful to use the quality of the set is outstanding diswasher and microwave safe the color matches the older set so no worries about the new glaze being slightly off i still think its a bit more purplish than whats pictured but it hasnt mattered much in the months since having it and ive noticed many plate designs have a sort of scribbly look to them it isnt a flaw to me anymore i dont use the mugs since i prefer my own ragtag collection but they do seem to be the weak link of the set the handles are a bit thin i wouldnt be surprised if it snaps off one day while removing it from the dishwasherall in all this is a great set for everyday use if you like the pattern or the color the brown looks lovely as well and are looking to upgrade from a cheap set of starter dishes this is the set for you
this is a very nice product quality materials and clear instructions for install as one who doesnt do much diy stuff around the house it is still a bit of a challenge the second kit i bought went in much easier by virtue of having a bit of experience the kit allows for a bunch of options of how you want to organize your closet the nice thing is you can always go back and redo it if your needs or moods change the price here goes up and down so put it in your cart and wait for it to go down to get the best deal i like the finished results
just got this ran a couple poppers of corn so i cant speak for the durability or longevity of the powercup concentrators or the popper itself i ordered an pack of the concentrators when i ordered this popper and was surprised to find it shipped with its own pack im putting in a couple of tablespoons of oil so should see a life of about a dozen poppers full of popcorn before the concentrator needs to be replaced it makes much better popcorn than the bags in my opinion without all the crap that goes in the bags it feels like it should survive for a time doesnt take up much room pops most of the kernels and was reasonably priced to start with over the years ive tried a couple of these and none really did what they claimed this is different takes about minutes seconds in my very old kenmore microwave cleanup is pretty negligible especially when compared with my favorite stove top popper
i got this for my wife because she never had a good place to store her scarves it is well made and compact in its design the hanger is thin and doesnt take up much room in your closet the top hanger hook rotates so you can turn the hangerorganizer so you can easily find the scarftiebelt you are looking forsometimes simple really is better i thought about keeping it to hang my ties on but im glad i didnt as it turns out she loved it now i am a heroi was provided a free sample for my honest review

i almost cried when my older cuisinart toaster died it had two long slots and toasted everything just great but when the cord got hot all the time after many years of use i knew it was time for a new toaster before i burned down our home i wish they didnt discontinue the older version as it was perfect this one is fine it is streamlined looks smaller than i visualized when i read the dimensions the finish is stainless steel but looks fine in my stainlesssteel kitchen i miss the two slots though it does fit two halves of bagels two slices of some breads but if you have an artisan bread you may have to use two cycles if you want two slices of bread it toasts nice not perfect but that may have to do with my uneven slicing of bread sometimes if it is a new kind of bread purchase or one with a lot of sugar like raisin bread i always start at a lower setting you can always toast a little more but cant scrape off all the black burned crumbs if you over toast once you know your breads you may not have to do much adjustment in the future the cord remains cool
i cant imagine a more wonderful elegant teapot in the world this has to be the prettiest darn teapot ive ever seen pictures dont do this any justice the glass is a gorgeous delicate clear form the most perfect dimensions in the world the handle is a pale pink glass ribbon the cover is capped with a delicate rose in the same light pink glass the teapot is made of modern sturdy heatproof glass but has the look of depression glass i am simply amazed at how elegant this is for such a reasonable pricethe teapot is in fact dripless pouring a cup of tea is simple and there is never a stray drip of tea the body is wide and low so it is easy to pour exactly the amount of tea you want the teapot looks so delicate i was concerned about pouring boiling water into it that was a crazy thought the teapot is designed for those hot temperatures and can withstand the thermal shockthe little cup inside is perfect for loose tea there are a series of tiny slits in the bottom of that cup to allow water to flow through but keeps back the tealeaves one of the first cups i brewed was with old tea that had a ton of fines very little got through the fine slits what did get through settled to the bottom of the pot and never got into my teacup that wide round shape also helps with fines settlingi absolutely adore this teapot it is perfect for just over two cups of tea contrary to it looking very small this pot amazes me it has all the feel of an antique
i use this mainly to mix my protein shakes and its fine for that problem being i like my protein shakes to have the consistency of a wendys frosty so i like to freeze it until its slushy its not so good for that trying to mix or blend something icy will set this motor in a tailspin a piece of the plastic molding has fallen off but it will still mix a shakei wanted something quick and easy to use as i didnt feel like having to clean a blender everyday but on second thought thats probably the best option especially if i ever i want to make a smoothie out of my shakes
firstly this thing was a bit of a pain to remove from the packaging its a very tight packing job and i almost stabbed right through the mattress im guessing youre not here for the anecdotal shenanigans so lets get to the reviewthe first thing that bummed me out about this mattress is that its one sided there will no rotating of this bed sadly once i laid it down though i found myself pretty pleased with how soft the outside felt but how firm the mattress felt i did notice that when i put my knee on it to crawl into bed and i applied pressure i could almost feel the box spring yikes that tells me that if you are a big person im ibs this bed might not be for you laying flat out my toes hang off a bit im but most people dont lay like thatall in all im happy with the mattress considering the price i think it just went down too ill update once ive had it for a month or two
ive had this kettle for almost a year now and i am glad i have decided to buy it despite the bad reviews for me it is working great and i love it i use it several times a day i have an electric tea maker from tfal that i bought in france but if i dont want to use the tea maker i can just make the perfect cup of tea using the right temperature also i have a coffee french press and if you want to make a good cup of coffee you need to be able to heat the water at the perfect temperature this kettle has a french press setting i have nothing bad to say about this kettle and i hope it last for a few years i really recommend this item its worth the price if like me you make coffee in a coffee press and if you love different kind of tea
i hardly need to review this coffee maker as there are so many great reviews i got the able brewing kone coffee filter for chemex coffee maker stainless steel reusable for it which costs a fortune as i didnt want to be using throwaway paper and ordering them etc it all works i can foresee that this will break in my care but for the price its well worth it i will just get another one and the big investment the filter will have already been made i went to youtube to see how to make the coffee and proceeded to use the method i found there its not rocket science ive noticed some people dont think my coffee is strong because there is no and i mean no acidity to it i can drink it very strong and black because of this i love it i ordered a bunn warmer for it but it hasnt arrived yet so well review that part later obviously we like it five stars
the oxo overthedoor towel rack was easy to put together and doesnt have the flimsy feel that i was concerned about it attaches to most any door in my home but i chose to put it in the guest room i like to encourage reuse of bath towels and having this towel rack in the guest room allows them to hang their towel after use without any concern that it may be used by others if left in the bathroom it easily fits two large bath towels on the two lower racks and hand towels and wash cloths on the upper which is just enough besides the ease of use the style is nice and will fit many different decors
i was looking for a good silky pillowcase to keep my hair more manageable and shiny and i finally found it i wanted silk but it is so expensive and with the cheap imitations out there one has to be very carefuli decided to go with a satin instead as to be sure i didnt end up with faux silk with a huge price tag attached ad i am so glad i didit really feels like pure silk and the second best part is the covered zippers no slipping off the pillow in my sleep it stays put and is high quality material i am planning to buy more in more colors
make no mistake about it this thing is humongous centimeters wide pounds empty and about thirty pounds full forget about bringing it to the table to serve from just leave it on the stove with a ladle in itthat said ive had mine for about three years and i love it the small bottom diameter makes it easy to sweat onions celery and carrots to start out a soup or stew recipe if youre browning meat ive found what works best is to treat the pot like a wok brown the meat in the center right over the heat and then stack the alreadybrowned or waiting pieces around and up the sides to get them out of the way until you add the liquid once youve added the liquid the tapered sides will reduce the dish quickly if you dont want evaporation the heavy heavy lid fits snugly and lets the pot maintain a slow simmer for hours ive let mine go overnight with no problemsi regularly make triple batches of chili and spaghetti sauce in this and occasionally use it for apple butter six quarts of apples peeled cored a pint of sweet wine or grape juice and a quarter teaspoon of ground allspice down to one quart of butter in six hours no fuss no mess no trouble its a wonderful addition to any serious kitchen
i use this on my nightstand next to my bed its compact and easy to use my power strip does not fit in the little cubby in the back i use the anker w port usb charger and that fit nicely in the space i have the power strip on the floor behind my night stand this station holds all the wires out of sight and it looks so much nicer now when charging our iphones i put it upside down on the station since it wont stay upright with it plugged in at the base of the phone i use the shelf on the very top to hold extra ipods and other doo dads i wish it were just a tad wider so i couldve fit my power strip and anker in there together other than that its a great charging station simple and neat
this is great for storing my kcups and freeing up cabinet space i was able to set my keurig coffee maker right on top of the unit which is actually the way this item is intended for use i have seen some reviews from others who cant do that because of countercabinet space limitations but it works great for me i do have one issue i am dealing with and that is the rattlenoise of the drip rack on the coffee maker itself while brewing this is due to the fact that the storage drawer is not solid of coursehow would it have drawers otherwise and when i am making a cup of coffee that metal drip rack vibrates terribly i have made a temporary fix by taking a rubber piece of rug matting the kind with the holes and sitting the drip tray on that works much quieter but i plan to get a package of the tiny rubber dots that people use for glass table tops etc and see if that stops the noise from the vibration lowes and home depot both sell them my problem has nothing to do with this product i love it because it does what it was made to do and it seems to be a very well made item
we get a lot of use out of this coffee maker at home ive been living with this for months and it makes waking up for my morning commute a little easier our morning pot of coffee is now set with the timer so i can refuel by the time i can walk to the kitchenthe kcup option was initially something on the nice to have list and im impressed how nice it is to have cold afternoons are filled with hot tea and cocoa hot afternoons are filled with iced tea by the glass the convenience is greatthe kcup dispenser isnt very intuitive to load the first time but it works reliably you have to press the k cup completely into the loading tray slide the loading tray into the unit press down on the loading trays handle load the water put the cup under the spout then on the face of the unit twist the selector knob to the single serve option and then press the power button just a minute later your drink is served
the virtue of these little darlings is that they are so simple it is hard to imagine them not working and that is true they are just a single block of plastic brought to a fine taper on two sides and thick on two other sides in order to grasp it firmly the corner where the tapered sides meet is rounded to fit the rounded bottom of pans the plastic is hard but just flexible enough that you will not scratch steel iron aluminum or copper be careful with copperthe only drawback which you have probably surmised is that since there is no handle there is a good chance you may get gunk on your knuckles when you put your hand down in the dirty pots heres a clue wear rubber gloves when using these scrapers you will be happy for doing that
s the other reviewers have stated this is a top notch knife extremely comfortable to hold and well balanced like all of the ken onion knives and of course razor sharpmy only qualm is that this knife does not feel like a santoku it feels more like a chefs knife due to the fact that it has a bolster which santoku do not traditionally have this may or may not be a bad thing depending on your personal preference but i would suggest trying it out before purchasingnote that i am not knocking the bolster or handle design itself the ergonomics are fantastic and the ken onion chefs knife is probably my favorite knife but personally i do not like the way that it applies to this particular style of bladei decided to purchase the shun elite santoku instead which is only slightly more expensive and has sg powdered steel which is harder than the vg steel on the classic and ken onion lines
i was kinda worried theyd be really floppy or something from the reviews theyre stiff enough to easily put in the fridge without spilling if you dont fill them to the top i leave like inch empty and the ice expands right to the top makes em really easy to fill put in the fridge i even stack that way without any problems at all also they are really easy to get out of the tray too its flexible enough to just push em out flex it like a normal ice tray to separate from the sides and its pretty easy glad i got sets and replaced my old normal ones loving these things oh and they take up less space in my small freezer too
i just received this iron and im very impressed it makes the chore of ironing fun and fast the iron gets very hot if needed for jeans and there is a lot of steam it comes with a special styled plastic cup for filling the iron with water which makes it easy the digital control is easy to set for cotton rayon polyester blends etc i like the feature that beeps so you know its at the right temperature it takes the guesswork out of which setting you should use for the fabric type i had a rowenta which is over rated and over priced i highly recommend this iron
bought the salt and pepper shakers about four years ago to use with my callaway dinnerware set i love how these shakers match the set and how nice they look togetheri also love the size of these shakers as they are easy to grasp thanks to the slight curvature in the body design they are also of good size meaning you dont have to fill them up too often note the shakers are made from stoneware so they are not an exact match with the dinnerware as the dinnerware is made from the usual corelle materialfor ease of care as you can wash the shakers in the dishwasher when neededrecommend
i have a set of six of these bowls in scarletthey certainly add drama and festivity to the table i use them for salads and the bright red color really compliments the colors of the vegetables in the salad i usually use a plain white linen tablecloth and really they do more justice than my table even deservesive had these for a long time and i havent chipped one yet they are very durable and easy to care formade in the usa i highly recommend these bowls for casual and even formal use the scarlet color really adds a very fun and elegant touch to your table definitely a star product
ive had this press for some time now and use daily its still like new no cracks damage to rubber or leaks i have an instant hot water faucet and after pressing my morning coffee into my mug just add hot water and im good to go clean up is a breeze used this winter to make evening decaf with flavored creams yes one needs a bit of patience to press pump part but you dont end up with a cup full of grounds like with the presses great for one person ive also discovered the difference between drinking colored water and a good cup of strong stronger strongest however you want it coffee would recommend
its not as good as the bristle brushes at spreading melted butter onto stuff so theres that its fairly good at it though it just takes a touch more time the advantage is that youll never end up with bristles on your stuff this seems really sturdy and wellmade i cant imagine what it would take for it to come apart but it would have to be quite a bit not a lifechanger or anything and can be a little annoying to have to go back more than i feel strictly necessary to get butter spread on things but it was fairly cheap looks like it will stay together and ill never have to deal with fishing a bristle off of the top of bread dough again
this shelving unit was delivered right on time todaythe shelves were so easy to put together took less than minutesi put it in my computer room for easy storageaccess to my printer laminator binders etcso really there is nothing to heavy that is placed on it but i did notice that on the bottom of each shelf it stated no more than pounds per shelf which is no bother to me because i didnt buy it for holding really heavy itemsthe shelves are a decent width a full size printer will fit on the shelf just fine and still have a inch clearing so it will not fall off the shelfit also has anchor holes in the back of each shelf so it could be easily attached to the wallthe shelf is about foot in height about foot in length and about widthso all in all i will be buying more of these shelves in the future
not sure what anyone else is talking about when they complain about the odor my nose doesnt find this product to have any sort of strong smell certainly not after its been diluted per the directions capfull per scooba tank of waterfyi that dilution is supposed to give cleaning cycles per bottle for me that will probably mean one bottle every two months i have areas that need cleaning i figure i will clean twice a week at the addon item price thats pretty reasonable but still expensive compared to say pinesol or even murphys oilhonestly i am not sure this does a whole lot better than just plain water but even if it only improves cleaning by i think its justifiable especially if youre not paying x or more per bottle directly from irobot
ive been using humdifiers for years and have tried every type the cool mist ones mildew up quickly and the wicks are expensive the ultrasonics are nice but unless you use distilled water you run the risk of breathing in bacteria from tap water since the mist is cool and the water and any particulates that are in the water are nebulized into the air the warm mist are the best since the water is boiled and only the steam escapes i have used many brands of warm mist humidifiers over the years holmes duracraft and honeywell this crane model is the best yet it hasnt leaked once the tank size is adequate for a medium sized bedroom i run mine on the low setting and it goes for hours easily the operation is quiet the other brands ive tired all have the same basic design the heating element is round with a hole in the middle and is difficult to scrub on all sides if there is a lot of hard water build up this design has a solid heating element built into the bottom of the unit and can be scrubbed easily with a brush to remove build up there is some basic weekly maintenance required but its not difficult you need to use distilled white vinegar to dissolve build up and disinfect one thing i dont particularly like is the blue light that comes on when the unit is turned on its not bright enough to light up the whole room kind of like a nightlight but for folks who like pitchblack when they sleep this may not be for you im glad i found this brand and model for the price its a great machine
to measure or not to measure that is the question whether it is nobler in the kitchen to use stainless or suffer the slings and arrows of neighbors who know you secretly use plastic when they arent aroundto sift to measure no more plastic and by this recycle bin we say to end bye bye plastic the heartache and the shock of discovering that you have just used instead of the numbers on the plastic worn this is a consummation devoutly to be wished when ere the stainless dips into the flour yay that first time verily i say unto you in the words of my uncle allez cuisinetake no pause grip the good of the grip of good my fair stainless nymph of kitchen tools be all my measuring remembered
great little fryer for people i wanted something compact easy to clean and a fryer that heated up quickly i got everything i asked for in this one the only problem i have is im not crazy about the way the handle is made its difficult to attach and release from the basket although with more use that part could loosen up a bit i also wish the handle would fold down while attached only because i dont like having to remove the handle every time i want to store the item under the cabinetso far everything i have fried has turned out with crisp perfection no excess oil in food no mushy batter and its doesnt overheat the oil
the hamilton beach easy reach toaster oven looks so retro scifi cool and is perfect for many of my baking and toasting needsperfect for toasting bread bagels and english muffins and toasts so well i took my toaster off the counter and put it away great for individual tv dinners and frozen sandwiches or frozen snacks it works for baking a few slices of texas toast garlic bread a few biscuits a few rolls or a few muffins nice to be able to bake or broil shrimp fish or a chicken breast all those things i hate having to heat up an entire oven forthe timer can be set for up to minutes if i need it to be set for a longer period of time i can either reset it after minutes or use a separate timer its not that big of a deal for me this is the first toaster oven ive owned with a timer on it so im thrilled to have any length of time available on itthis toaster oven is the easiest one ever to clean the top comes off for thorough cleaning a crumb tray that is a breeze to pull out to dump crumbs and replace and so easy to reach all around the inside to wipe up and clean any mess
i mostly use it for toasting bread but depending where you put the rack you either get very toasted on the top and barely any toasting on the bottom or very toasted on the bottom and barely any toasting on the top i wish it had a way to put the rack in the middle i could probably flip the bread over halfway through the cycle but thats not always convenient i also use it for heating snacks like frozen mozzarella bitessticks fries and chicken nuggets through trial and error i discovered that is best not to preheat before cooking mozzarella products i also figured out that chicken nuggets and fries need a higher cooking temperature than what is listed in their cooking instructions or else they come out a bit soggy i have not tried cooking a frozen pizza or using the broiler because im afraid of a big mess andor grease fireas some others mentioned the rack drops while trying to remove food not only is it annoying but can also be dangerous if you dont have a potholder in your hand to catch it i learned the hard way to keep a potholder in my hand when using the rack when i use the pan i remove it completely before removing the food another annoying issue is the crumb tray you have lift the entire oven make sure its cool and remove the rack turn it over pull the traybottom open its spring loaded and carefully shake the crumbs into the trash while trying to hold the traybottom open the spring makes it want to close i do not think it can be done without getting a lot of crumbs on the floor these annoyances are why i gave stars
my husband and i moved to florida and i was excited about decorating our screened in patio i purchased the suncast storage bin and absolutely loved it i had planned on getting some kind of small cheap garbage can for our patio i didnt even know that suncast made a matching garbage can until i saw it in my amazon similar products list at the bottom of the page it was pricier than i wanted to spend on an outside garbage can but i bought it without hesitation based on how much i love the storage bin its very easy to put together and is nice and sturdy once its done i think it took me five minutes and i was distracted watching tv while putting it together its been through some pretty high winds and two straight days of rain and hasnt moved the latch it great to keep any bugs that make it through a crack in the screen out of the garbage it looks very pretty people who have come over ask where the garbage is because it doesnt stand out as an obvious garbage can this has a lot of room in it which im sure well test out in the summer when my husband grills dinner each night hell love not having to empty it very often this was a great purchase i definitely understand why people use this as their kitchen garbage its definitely large sturdy and attractive enough luckily our golden retriever doesnt go through our kitchen garbage but if she did i wouldnt hesitate to use this garbage can for our kitchen
i bought this mandoline slicer almost months ago since then i have used it at least twice a week i use it mostly for cutting vegetables for salad cucumbers bell peppers tomatoes carrots celery it works great for it all what would have taken me over a half an hour with a regular knife takes only like minutes with this slicer i eat salad more often because i dont dread prepping all the vegetables anymorei also use this slicer a lot for steaming vegetables like carrots its really nice to get a consistent thickness so that it steams evenly its super sharp making it super easy to cut even super thick and hard vegetables like carrots and speaking of carrots using a regular knife the carrot slices would always go flying across my kitchen but with this slicer i just put it on top of a bowl and all the vegetables land nicely into the bowllike i said ive been using it for months now and it seems like the blade is just as sharp as when i first got itthe safety holder is really designed well it lets you slice vegetables right down to the nub and not have to worry about slicing your fingers off the prongs are super strong ive been rough with them and none of them have come loose or broke offthe only complaint i have is that i wish this slicer wasnt white when i cut carrots the carrots stain the slicer orange even if i wash the slicer with super hot soapy water immediately after slicing the carrots they still stain the slicer orange it doesnt happen with any other vegetable so far just carrotswith just one minor complaint i still emphatically give this slicer stars
i bought this wok based on the reviews posted here i have to say that i agree that it gets really hot and i am amazed at how well it performs that being said i have noticed that the nonstick surface has a lot of surface scratches and i use a plastic spatula yesterday i made beef lo mein and the pan was just as great as beforehand however upon washing it up in the sink i noticed that a piece of the nonstick had peeled off my experience with that coating suggests that this will continue to occur as i use the appliance more often this is very disappointing as this is the best performing wok that i have ever used im crossing my fingers hoping that the nonstick wont continue to peel that would certainly betray the overall performance of an otherwise excellent applianc
nysharp knife sharpener works well it stayed put and didnt move at all when i used it and it was very easy to use it is small and fits in my kitchen drawerit has a suction grip that once you set the lever it seals the sharpener down solidi was amazed at how sharp my steak knives are now i also sharpened some small chef knives and they are very sharp too i wont use it to sharpen my large chef knives but i have used it on all my dinner knives steak knives small chef knives and some bread knivesthe only reason i docked it a star is it is mostly made of plastic and so my knives have cut quite a few gashes already into the sharpener so i figure in a few years it is going to look hideous other than that it works well and my knives are now very sharp thumbs up
i had purchased a hoover windtunnel bagged upright vacuum years ago and have regretted every moment with that thing to recap my review of the hoover it has a head shaped like a hammerhead shark and those extensions are useless little or no edge cleaning and wide brush protector bars every couple inches which hold down the dirtpet hair onto the carpet requiring at least passes over each and every area of the carpet in order to suck up all the dirt that is visible the only plus for that machine is that it has great suction power but trying to change the bags is a nightmarehalf the time the bag cover will not come off at all i have actually had to stand on the vacuum while pounding on the release section with a hammer and piece of dowling covered in a towel to get the bag cover off what a horrible vacuum finally last week even tho i swore i would try to get a couple more years out of this thing and use up the many bags that i have for it after requiring nearly half an hour to finally get the bag cover off so i could change the bag i had had it so i took a gamble and bought the shark navigator liftaway vacuum even tho the head is about smaller across than the hoover i was able to vacuum up three rooms in the time it normally takes me to do one with the hoover great edge cleaning on all three sides the roller protectors are thin enough not to cause a problem so you only need to go over an area once plenty of suction easy to use no second release needed when going under a table and lowering the handle plus the handle is taller great for me because i am tall easy to empty out the contents quiet probably only half as loud as the hoover plenty of suction easy to use on tile and hardwood as well the hoover is useless on those the little head fits under and around things easily it navigates like the dyson ball is advertised to navigate easily curves around stuff lightweight almost selfpropelled on carpeting love it yes cleaning out a bagless vacuum is grosswith any bagless vacuum plus it has a washable filter so it is easy on the budget the only negative is that the tool holder is useless they get knocked off as you maneuver the vacuum but i can live with that have not tried as a carrycanister but that is another bonus if it works well
i got one for my apartment is it pretty hell yeah does it dry dishes well of course does it keep the counter dry not really first thing first you have to have no lip on the sink the little spout is almost flush to the counter i have about a mm steel lip so now it is balancing on the two kind legspegs and the spout second thing the stainless portion can move around like nobodys business third the cup holders and wine thingies hang over the tray so if you try to employ these expect wet counters last but definitely not least the spout works the tray does not water pools on it all the time as the back legs are too short and does not create a good enough angle the tray is also square with rounded edges with the spout in the middle of the one edge but nothing tapering from the other edge toward the spout this causes water to pool in the corners the edge the spout is on i got it this past march and two legs are broken i havent even used it since i havent move into the apartment i got it for im contacting simplehuman about it but i might just buy a cheap dish drying tray or may and setting the metal piece on that for drying
i got both this and the ikea type one to try out and this one has more usable room even though the ikea type one is longerit has little pockets on the sides too for shoving extra stuff but the cardboard bottoms keep the little tray areas open so there is more room but the ikea ones without the cardboard sag in the middle with stuff in them making it more narrow and sag into the next compartmentso the non cardboard bottom ones are better if you just want to cram a bunch of stuff in them or hardly anything but these are nicer if you want to organize and find stuff easily and are much more functional to use
this one is basically a waste of money we bought our first dyson animal vacuum back in and it was fantastic we used and abused it for over four years we have a large dog before we had any real problems with it after getting it serviced for at a local repair shop it worked great once again tired of lugging it up and down the stairs i decided to buy a second one this model for the second level of our house at first it worked alrighttheir claim that these vacuums lose is truebut we have had nothing but problems with this vacuum since we bought it last year the beater bar quit spinning we got it working again after taking it apart with the help of their number the canister is much smaller than the last one i have to empty it before im even half done vacuuming our sq foot living room but today was the last straw less than a year after i bought this vacuum it literally fell apart while i was using it i pulled the attachment out according to the directionsim no incredible hulk and the vacuum hose literally fell off the attachment and it wont go back together so im done with dyson id rather buy a vacuum and replace it every year than buy a vacuum that wont even last a year save your money on this one
this a a great toasterconvection oven the temperature for cooking and toasting items is perfect i havent used the baking feature but i am sure that will be perfect too i wouldnt have spent this much on a toasterconvection oven but i am glad that i did i plan on using this oven instead of my stoveoven to do a lot more cooking especially during the warmer months the oven is easy to clean and the crumb tray just pulls out and can be rinsed off easily wouldnt want another toasterconvection oven in the future besides a cuisinart proud to own this oven
i have occasionally seen shun traditional or shun ken onion on amazon specials for a nice price but just could not pull the trigger and order the other day i was in williams sonoma and they had this on a very special one day sale i bought this and another these shun are the sharpest that i have ever used i have a very nice set of real not fake sabatier knives that i ordered from france and love to use but even after taking to a master sharpener with a large wet wheel in madison wi they would never be as sharp as these are out of the boxi have used for mincing up spices on the chopping block and even slicing a thickskinned squash in half now this blade is a bit higherwider than a traditional santoku and the user needs some familiarization before applying downward pressure as it will tend to wobblei also bought a western style chefs knife and i will review that tooi will definitely get more shun knives
y impressed first of all it was shipped and delivered super fast and the packaging that it came in was unbeatable not only was it in a heavy duty box they also added extra heavy duty protection on all sides and corners of the outside of the box as well best packing job we have ever seen the contents were also packed very well and organized with all parts and pieces intact and in excellent shape then we were impressed to find that this table was made of solid wood with a beautiful finish no particle board at all the table went together quick easy and beautifully we had custom glass pieces made to cover the three shelves we love it
ignore my first silly opinion below i received these dishes and really love them i drop things a lot have ms and the first thing out i dropped a tumbler bounce skid no problem there is no chemical odor or any odor at all they are sturdy and so glad i bought them and that they are made in the usa no bph who knows waht that is recycled and everything good i will buy from this company again and recommend them without reservationi just ordered this set of dishes then began wondering how do they remove bph from the recycled plastic items used to manufacture their dishes i ordered a set of toddler dishes from amazon made by bela luna toys for my greatgrandaughter and they say their dishes are bpa free and are made from corn since im not a chemist and dont know about these things there must be a way to do it im going to contact the company that manufactures them and ask not how they manufacture them just how they know for certain they are bpa free they dont use it when they make them but until i know im giving one star i hope to be back with more stars and ill use them when they arrive and will not die from bph whatever that is dont tell me i wont understand
i love these containers i mainly wanted something to keep my fruits veggies fresher for longer the lids snapped on really easily on all sides just push the flaps down until you hear them click then you press in the center of the container and you hear a whistling sound that means its sealed when you want to open it just lift the green tab on the top and it will whistle again letting the air back in one of my favorite features of these containers is the little white dial on the top it has notches you just turn the dial to the date you put the food in the fridge and youll never be left guessing how many days your food has been in storage what an ingenious idea no other storage container offers that there is also a ridged waved design on the bottom of the containers and it keeps your food elevated from moisture which will keep your food fresh for longer i have several ozeri products and ive been extremely pleased with all of them they are always quality products at affordable prices
we got our ice cream attachment as a christmas present from my brother and made our first batch last night the bowl was in the freezer longer than the hours suggested in the manual and our ingredients were well chilled in the refrigerator after i mixed everything didnt use a cooked custard too much work for me i put it in the frig for about an hour or so but couldnt wait any longer so i set up the kitchenaid and started it on as per instructions then i poured in the mixture and let the machine run oh my that is goooood ice cream definitely soft serve i put the leftovers in an airtight container and stuck it in the freezer last night and snuck a couple spoonfuls earlier today and it was even betteri highly recommend this
we purchased this saeco in late january to replace a cuisinart grindandbrewwe liked the cuisinart but love this saeco it is easier to keep clean and brews great coffee all of the options for strength and number of cups etc are great the bean grinding is not silent but we did not expect it to bewe are hooked on this beantobrew our next one will have the thermal carafe though which we had with the cuisinart and loveda tip to prospective buyers and others who may have experienced beans getting stuck in the grinder shaftwe keep the bean hopper totally full rather than putting scoops of beans in with each brew i believe that keeps the shaft open and clean weve had no problem at all and love it highly recommended
ive had mine for about years now and it has performed great for my family im not sure why it received so many negative reviews it has great suction power for such a small machine and is not too heavy to prevent you from wanting to bring it out as needed i have children and a dog and it has held up well with light to moderate use over years i keep only water in the dispenser tank as a rinse as i use a spray bottle to apply cleanser to the spot this sucks up most of the waterspill which is important to me please keep in mind this is only a spot cleaner and if you use it as intended i think you will be very happy with it i only gave it stars as i do agree it does tend to retain some dirty water in the lower chamber under the extraction tank but as with any cleaning appliance regular is needed to keep it clean keep in mind it is sucking up nasty dirty spillsliquids i swish out the collection tank and then suck through the hose some warm soapy bleachwater to disenfect after every use its also a bit on the loud side but because its used for such a short time for spot cleaning it is acceptable and its great for spotshampooing out the car floor too
i finally found a vacuum that i enjoy using that works that doesnt give me grief every time i use it check out my other reviews to see what ive been through with all the other uprights ive owned im so glad to switch to a bagged canister vac i was so worried to spend this much money on a vac and then have issues with it like my others but this one was worth every penny so far i bought the miele callisto at my local vacuum place it was the least expensive model that was good with pet hairi had it going on a year so far and i still love it i named her rocket dog she follows me around the house like a loyal little companion the motorized carpet head is great on carpets the bare floor head is great on bare floors the menuverablility is awesomethe way the head swivels around furniture legs and lamps and fits under things is just great the adjustability in the length of the wand is easy and a pleasure just push of a button love love love retractable cord all parts are sturdy and solidno clouds of dirt and dust in your face like you get when you empty a bagless when you need to change the bag you just open release bag slide it out theres even a thing that you can pull down on the bag to cover the hole so dirt doesnt puff out of it and toss it away but the best part is when you put a new bag injust slide it into the slot and slam the lid shut done on all my previous bagged uprights it took like min to wrestle with the collar of the bag to push it onto the hole you know what im talking about this vacuum is heaven in that regard yes the bags are expensive but i have found that they hold a lot more dirt than youd expect im approaching a year with this vac and i have just started on my nd box of bags so that has not been as bad as i had thought those of you with bagless vacs these bags hold a ton more dirt because they compact it all so far this vac has been a pleasure thank you rocket dog
i bought these glasses because we were looking for a bigger glass than the normal set you get with dishes got tired of only getting one or maybe two drinks and having to get up and fill my glass again they are pretty and surprisingly there were only two of each color and the extra blue and purple they show in the picture turned out to be redpink colored ones which didnt bother me anybut i am unhappy about the quality of the glass there is a raised edge on the rim of the glass that is sharp enough to irritate your lip and forget about licking the rim if you spill a little i had already washed them before i drunk out of them so its to late for me to return them we just have to drink out of them carefully until i can find some better oz glasses to replace them if it did not have that rim problem they would be perfect but since the rim problem i have to say i hate the product since i do not fill safe to give them to my kid to drink out of them without worrying about her cutting her lip or tongue also i would never give them to guest
s with the other reviewers i agree that this bag is bulky but very handy i am forever forgetting to bring my bags with me when i go shopping and end up kicking myself for once again leaving all my bags in the car and having to use the plastic bad for the environment bags at stores now i carry the envirosax bag with me everywhere i am using it in place of my purse yes it is a bit bulky but for me it far outweighs the alternitave of plastic this bag is made very well quality wise it is superior to many i have seen especially for the price i loaded it up with books just to see how it would handle a heavy loadbeautifully be environmentally aware while being fashionable as well
my old coffee maker was too large for one person it took up a lot of counter space and in my little kitchen it looked so out of place that when it i decided a single serve coffee maker would be the way to go so i wanted a more modern and sophisticated version of the old coffee maker and i found and purchased the hamilton beach i thought the design was slimmer than all other units it was taller than most and the stainless steel made it look more modern and sophisticated it does make good coffee however it does not have a hotplate to keep the coffee warm had i known this in the beginning im not sure i would have purchased it
the weighmax electronic scale is as described works well so far and the price was very reasonable i would have preferred the black one however if that had been an option at the time that i made my purchase delivery was slow probably not the sellers fault though ups says they attempted delivery when in fact they didnt was here all day on the day the tracking info said they made their attempt the package went to the local post office and i did not get a notice that it was there i went online to check where it was and thats when i found out about the supposed attempted delivery
i dont like electric can openers so i am always looking for a nice manual one ive purchased a couple of really expensive european models from specialty cooking stores i love those places but i tend to spend a lot of money on impulse and then i dont always use the things that i buy the expensive pairs are nice but i have to say that they are not as comfortable as this one i hate looking for a can opener when i need one so i keep several around for the price this is a great value and even though i have large hands its really comfortable
i am the owner of a bbretreat in southern california and i am also a professional chef for my boutique restaurant at the retreat and i purchased these pans because our pans in the main cooking area were needing to be replaced i thought quality was a second name for any cuisinart product wrong this is truly a set of pans that i would advise you not to even buy for a childi always use low temperature on all of our caphalon and copper pansso i am no stranger to low temp cooking on quality cookware howevereven minimum heatthe lowest heat source can be too much for these pans i am unable to produce two sets of scrambled eggs in a row because the second set sticks in the middleon extremely low temp trying to cook a small pan of popcorn for one of guests today produced burned or unpopped pop cornsomething that has never happened with the caphalon or the stainless pans i have used in the pasti will be returning these as quickly as i can i dont know what difference if anytheir next step up is in this line of cookwarebut i would highly advise against purchasing this product a total waste of money and timevery unhappy chef
finally something seen on that actually works like it should ill admit i havent really made that much meatloaf in the past so im no expert i got this though because i really liked the idea of the fat draining out of the meat and the loaf lifting out so easily after getting this i went and got some turkey meatloaf from the local marked meat counter and after adding some of my own ingredients popped it in the oven the pan is large so you actually need lbs worth of meat to fill it for a full size loaf i only got lb worth of meat so the loaf was half as tall but still came out well when the meatloaf was done it came right off the lift out tray thing without sticking the liquid fat had also drained to the bottom of the pan as well just like on the commercial the pan and the lift out thing are nonstick but the instructions still tell you to cover them well with nonstick spray prior to use its a good tip because some of the tomato sauce i used burned on the sides of the pan but just peeled off afterwards making cleanup simple everythings dishwasher safe which makes cleanup effortless too finally it comes with a nice cook book with several recopies including one for meat stuffed bell peppers like they show on the infomercial i plan on making meatloaf from scratch by trying the meatloaf in the book next time because based on the ingredients it looks like it would taste a lot better than my store bought turkey meatloaf mix lol all in all highly recommended
i just received this kitchen aid grinder today replacing a cuisinart that served me well of several years and is still going i am seriously disappointed its probably going back unless i can work out a solution to it scattering grinds all over the place it has a really serious design flaw in the seal that supposedly seals the lower collection bin from the grind downspout it doesnt seal its about short resulting in coffee grounds spraying all over the counter especially toward the fronti did find somewhat of a solution but its really mickey mouse on a grinder this expensive that is to fold a paper towel into eighths and place it under the collection bowlbin to tighten the springseal but this greatly detracts from the convenience and ease of use the loose fit on the collection bowl means that if it is stored and someone moves it it can easily slide out and break i cant believe how poorly engineered the collection bin is another is that it does not shut off automatically as did the cuisinart nor is there any timer it just grinds everything in the upper bin until switched off it is gone or will even overflow the collection bin making more of a mess also a mess is the ease of grinds to lodge in the grinder causing any bump to dislodge them you really almost need to leave the collection bin in place before moving it and then you run the risk of the glass bin sliding out and breaking nothing will make a house dingier than coffee grinds and dust and this thing really produces thoseit is also heavy and bulky it must weight five times the cuisinart i did not expect it to weigh nearly as much as my ka stand mixer but it seems towith those negatives out of the way there are some solid positives it is solid and very heavy duty so it should last if one can find a workaround for the sloppy collection jar and nonseal mechanism did i say some ka engineers really need to find other work ive only ground one bin so far and the results are sill brewing i mostly use a hour cold brew system or french press so i cant comment yet on the end results im pretty sure the coffee will be good but that was also true of my much less expensive lighter handier and cleaner cuisinart it is also relatively quiet with a low rpm ive had or previous grinders and this is the quietest so farif i can find a better alternative collection bin or better workaround than paper towels i just may keep it but even being a general fan of ka products i am really disappointed in this onei may update this later
this cookware is the best i have ever owned the quality is excellent i bought them thru amazon prime for so i felt that was very affordable compared to store prices it cleans so easy without soaking required food does not stick but of course when making something like spaghetti sauce u get tomato buildup around the pot but with my finger i can unlodge it easily it is also beautiful to look at with the black main area and beautiful orange handles that are ovenproof to degrees the clear glass lids do fog up on the stovetop and sometimes u can not see thru to your meal but i like to slow cook a lot of things and i mix a lot so u have to take to lid off anyway a friend said to me that all i did was pay for the name well if thats true the name was well worth it i love this set and would recommend them to anyone i have an electric range not gas
s ive recently gotten into cooking heavily for the first time in years i noticed a lot of the recipes used food processors and decided to purchase one even though theyre pricey it along with my dutch oven was one of the best kitchen decisions ive made first time i used it to mince an onion in seconds i was hooked and its been great at everything from grinding meat to simple shredding jobs havent tried using it to make dough yet so cant speak to that but its done well w everything ive tasked it with thus far and hope itll be around for a long time in the kitchen
i gave up on the big hard box to store my sterling flatware a long time ago who wants to crawl under the bed to retrieve their place settings now all are close at hand and i use them more often i cleaned my flatware well with silver polish before storing in the liner now it is clean every time i go to use i bought this particular tarnish protector for a set of heirloom silverplate which i am gifting to my niece my hope is that she will use and enjoy the pieces often as i do mine and not stuff them under her bed to gather dust
family member had requested a black decker steam mopblack decker sm steam mop with smart select technologyfor her new wood laminate floors we bought the steam mop to try out then give to her so we could make an educated decision when buying a steam mop for our home we immediately fell in love with the idea of a steam mop but noted several cons of the black decker model including the single steam hole the need for the small funnel cup and the cost of the replacement pads after trying the black decker i decided to shop around for a different model of steam mop for our home after reading numerous reviews and browsing similar models at a local box store we settled on the haan slim and light we are in love with this steam mop the haan notably has holes for steam instead of the single hole on the black and decker the entire water bottle removes for easy refilling no special cups needed the replacement steam padshaan rmf pack replacement pads blueare about half the cost of the replacement pads for the black decker model my husband has partial paralysis on one side of his body affecting both his hand and his leg making simply daily tasks more challenging he enjoys using the haan over the black decker steam mop he is not able to use a traditional mop the haan has given him the ability to do one more household task for himself without being reliant upon othersallinall we both love our new haan slim and light steam mop and really appreciate how much easier it is to clean our wood laminate and ceramic tile floors
i needed a fan for consumer household use my requirements were powerful and quiet this fan exceeds my expectations in both categories i am going to use it as a substitute for air conditioning when needed the shape of it is a little more nonstreamlined and awkward then a normal blade fan causing it to take up a bit more room but it is still smaller than a box fan i cant believe the power to noise ratio on this thing its really incredible out of the box the exterior construction seemed sort of like cheap plastic but once i turned the thing on i didnt care id have to update this review in a few months to really comment whether the plastic holds up but i suspect it will be fine unless i drag it on some cement for a while
i just got the amico and took it for a quick spin today it does a really good job getting bakedon crud off my stovetop cleaning grout and taking gunk off my floor i am impressed it comes with a nice selection of accessories and a storage bag i had a tough time choosing between this and the enviromate pronto but im glad i got this one it seems wellmade and it is easy to use it does take two hands if you use the hose attachment one to hold the body and press the trigger and the other to maneuver the attachment but that is no problemi have a large white wing steamer but its awkward to haul up and down the stairs the amico works best for spot cleaning and smaller jobs and it only weighs pounds
i loved these sheets months ago i based my purchase on the several good reviews and the problem with some reviewers is that they put up reviews so quickly they dont give things like sheets time to see if they will hold up i like to wait especially when as we all know over time bad sheets will start to ball upi purchased sets of sheets all around the same time so i am not only using these sheets i am using other sets of sheets so imagine if i were only using these and how frequently they would have to be washed how quick they woouldve started balling upthe shiny soft look doesnt lasti shouldve known at the price that they were not going to hold up long they are no longer soft i feel like i am sleeping on little crumbs i constantly swipe my hand across hoping to wipe all it off i am just in denial i guess of the fact that its just my sheets its not coming off
i am very impressed with this thermal tea infuser first there is definitely an improvement in the flavor of the tea when it is brewed and consumed in a glass container i never quite believed that was true but this infuser has proved to me that it is not just an old wives talei also like the size of the inner glass infuser if i am in the mood for a larger cup of tea it fits nicely into my large mugs and can be removed easily when the brewing is done in fact this infuser has made my bodum ounce tea press a little obsolete i used to use the press if i wanted a large single mug of tea but this works just as well if not better than the small press the press has a plastic infuser rather than glasssome of the loose tea i drink is made into or small balls of tea wrapped with jasmine or other enhancers this infuser works much better than my stainless steel tea ball for the blends that are pearls as it allows the leaves to unfold completely giving me fuller flavor in my teaall in all i would rate this product stars in terms of quality ease of cleaning and most important for the wonderful cup of tea it brews enjoy
have been using it a year now the one thing i do notice is that it must work hotter than other slow cookers in recipes sometimes i have it on the least amount of time given in the recipe and the food is overcooked i let it cool and then i put the insert in the dishwasheri have used it or times so far and it worked really well i am very careful with the ceramic piece after i read the other reviews i rinse it out and then put it in the dishwasher it looks nice sitting on the counter so fingers crossed
i make homemade ice cream and was using small glad and ziploc plastic bowls for individual servings needless to say the glad and ziploc bowls dont last very long especially if theyre dropped on the floor while frozen i ordered a set of the extreme freeze reditainers and i love them their shape allows me to easily and securely stack them i bought the bowls for individual servings of ice cream but use them to store many different things i depend on them so much i ordered a second set theyre very heavy duty easily twice the thickness of glad or ziploc
this little machine spits out a nice cup of coffee a nice small cup of coffee if you look at the instructions for each variety it reads that they all are under ounces some are closer to the ounce mark if you go over that then youre just brewing water because the capsules run out of coffee and milk after a certain amount of water flows through them youll actually see it flow clear the machine itself brews quickly and hot it does make fancy coffee drinks mocha latte cappuccino chai etc but these drinks can be very expensive a single box of capsules for a latte drink is and only brews cups milk capsules coffee capsules and these are small cups if you want a larger mug youre going to have to use two of each it would be fun for an office or for a dorm if you have the money to keep buying the capsules id think of it as more of a once in a while thing and not something to use daily
first this thing is really soft it has that comfy beaded feel no thats not describing it right its like those tiny foam beads that are in stuffed things its really quite comfortableyou cycle through the massage settings which is a good way to experience them all if you werent inclined to check them all out in the first place there is a nice variety and they all feel great when youre stuck in the car for a long or even traveling via planei never attached mine to a headrest but it works great without one my batteries didnt last too long but that could be because my two kids decided it was the coolest thing in the world and therefore had to use it every chance they got so it is totally something that kids can work too and its not like they can hurt it just burn through the batteries fasterso far it hasnt held any smells and has remained fresh smellingin short this neck travel pillow is great if you fall asleep its supportive it massages you kids can use it its easy to use and doesnt smell funky id say win definitely worth getting if youre in the market for a travel pillow i received this product in exchange for an honest review
the hamilton beach coffee maker is great it brews a great tasting cup of coffee and is so easy and convenient to use if you like it strong use the button regular strength use the button very simple the coffee maker is very well constructed i especially like the used to measure your coffee and doubles as the main filter just scoop the coffee into it shake a little to level the grounds and insert it in the machine then press one of the brewing strength buttons and youre done brews a oz mug of coffee super fast the coffee tastes great i use folgers or maxwell house regular ground coffee a perfect cup every time to those reviewers that complained that the coffee was to weak and like colored water read the instructions you only use the amount of coffee in the that is clearly marked on it using too much will not allow the water to properly drip through the grounds so using extra coffee is not only wasteful it will result in a subpar cup of coffee which is something i really like the machine doesnt use a lot of coffee to make a great tasting cup great job hamilton beach im glad i didnt buy one of those over priced machines that use the kcups
substantial is a word i seldom use anymore for products i purchase it used to be fairly easy to find substantial things the kitchen set i bought years ago and still hasnt come apart at the joints or the real cotton linens compared to the flimsy stuff they sell now my mothers pots i still use so unlike the one i bought last year that is chipping away already i really like buying things that seem like they will last for at least a decade although i know im making the manufacturing world angry by not purchasing new at least every year i sure hope this kettle lasts a long time because it certainly looks and feels like a substantial item dont make a liar out of me farberware perfect design easy to clean fast to boil hefty it doesnt whistle dont care it boils so quickly i dont leave the kitchen i love this and hope it outlasts me
i got one and immediately bought more to gift people for what you pay you get great functionalitya steel sharpening stick only straighten the edge of the knife of course ceramic being harder than steel will both sharpen and straighten the edgeit being a stick its easy to keep a decent sharpening angle and whip it all over blades much more easily than a whetstoneive used it to sharpen kitchen knives scissors pocket knives and the bigger serations in a spyderco knife ive even used it to unsharpen the rim of a stainless wine glass a little work on a cheap cuisinart fibrox knife and it was shaving off armhairs something ive seen few knives do
i have small hands so i am always comfortable using scoops like this one the pointed edge and the curve really do help me dig into ice cream and yes since it is stainless steel i can run it under hot water to help the process nothing like a good metal scoop that is hot to cut through the most frozen ice creamhowever while the handle is perfect for me it appears to be smaller than most of the scoops i have used in the past and with a shorter handle you dont have as much leverage in working with the ice cream you also are closer to the ice cream and might get your hands in the mess more easilywhile i would give it five stars for me i received a complimentary sample to review and i want to be fair to anyone who has bigger hands than i do so four stars with a shout out about the shorter handle
i ordered this product twice and both times it arrived dented and chipped this is really amazons fault though because all they do is put it in a plastic sleeve and put it in the box and ship this product really needs more cushioning because once it dents the nonstick coating begins to chip and once a chip begins all the coating will come off quicklybut for now while the coating is still on i baked with it a few times now the size fits nicely into a normal sized oven yet its cups i made tarts in these still lightly greasing each cup with vegetable oil and the pastry came out easilygreat product id just hesitate to buy again until amazon protects it in shipment a bit more
i had been using my omega juicer and although it makes good juices putting it together and cleaning it was a pain i saw the vitamix being demonstrated at costco and after tasting the tortilla soup and smoothie they handed out i was sold i didnt buy the they were demonstrating because costco had a off in store coupon for the and there is no difference in the motor between both modelsi was a little intimidated with the size and power of the vitamix so first i watched the dvd that came with it and reviewed the getting started cookbook i also went online to register which gave me access to more recipes so far ive made a few kinds of green smoothies so easy and delicious and some soups my favorite soup so far is red pepper crab soup which can be found on their websitei would have rated this stars because of the noise level save your hearing wear ear plugs when using this despite the noise level i will be selling my blender and juicer this does it all
this is a cheap tub stopper that works very well and is compatible with almost any tub the stopper is essentially a silicone circle with a diameter of about inches as long as the stopper can cover your drain hole and it should it will perform its functionthe stopper also has a little suction cup at the tip that helps it stay in place and stick to tile it wont stop your children from removing it and draining the bath water but its a nice touchmuch to my surprise the stopper is also reasonably attractive in person the stainless steel center helps the product look and feel a little less cheap
the polder thermometer came with a stainless steel probe thats attached to a braided steel cable i loved mine and bought several however there were complaints about the original probe that it would fail if you got the cable wet so polder went to the plastic cable imho that was a mistake i recently used mine in a bbq and the cable melted id rather worry about getting the cable wet than worry about melting it in the bbq since i mainly use it while bbqing fortunately i have several of the old cables i hope polder comes up with a plan soon that allows the probe to be washed and also used in high heat
i really like this vacuum its nice not having to mess with a cord keep unplugging a vacuum to move to a closer outlet as you move throughout the house and the suction is really good that was the part i was most surprised by you do have to keep the white foam filter clean which they say to use only water no detergent and let it dry for hours im thinking of getting another filter so i can use the vacuum while waiting for the filter to dry the battery charger is good too it lets you know when the battery is chargedno cord lightweight good suction and you can enable the beater bar from a switch near the top of the handle it also has an led that lets you know when the battery is getting low bars high med and low remaining battery power the power and suction as they claim does stay consistently high until youve only got a minute or so left and the low led light starts blinking id easily buy it again
fter seeing waffle makers reviewed on cooks country and this one called out as the best i went ahead and ordered it my family loves waffles but of them come from eggo im not a big fan of super thick belgian waffles so i thought this would be a good compromise turns out it makes something more akin to a waffle pancake or thick crepe i could not get them crispy though they would get very dark in color when i turned the dial up to to give you a sense of the finished product think of something about thinner than an eggo i ended up returning mine to amazon and will try out another makemodelthe design controls etc were all very good though the darkness control was oddly loose cleanup was indeed a breeze and the unit was nice and compact so i wouldnt discount all chefs choice products but this one simply fell short of my expectations
we have a stand up glass shower stall in our master bathroom this strip has very good review for waterresistant but no one mentioned if it would stick well on glass surfacewe wanted to hang out heavy bath towel up on the outside of the stall and i was afraid that it would not be able to hold the weight however for i took a chanceafter weeks of usage i can report that this sticks on very well on glass surface theres no sign that it will fall off any time soon i even tug it down to test it and it seems very sturdy the heavy towel even after it has been use wet can be hung no problem i followed the instructions exactly and im very happy with this productalthough the area i use it will never be wet im just surprise at how strong the hold is on glass surfaceim ordering more i highly recommend the command b bathroom hook and waterresistant strips hook strips if you want to stick this on your glass surface
great item for the summer corn season and so easy to use one ear takes about minutes two take about minutes you put cup of water in each chamber and it steams perfectlythe lid does not snap on as some expect but fits on the top of the chamber the corn will be hot and perfectly cooked kind of fun to have this at the office too very handyof course you could steam anything in this but it is designed for corn as for size it has worked well so far if one were to have extra large ears of corn i think it would still work though you might adjust the cooking time up a bit best for mediumlarge ears i thinkperfect for singles college age and seniors who wants to fool with a pot boiling water salt draining and cleanup when this is an option one of the best
i bake a lot so i have at least oven thermometers in the oven at any given time i also use an instant read thermometer i bought this thermometer because of the big numbers i wanted something i could just look through the oven window and know the temperature without having to bend down or get a small flashlight to read the numbers this thermometer was constantly degrees or more off every time and i have used it every day since i bought it i have never seen an oven thermometer so off before so i would not recommend this item even though i love the big numbers
i bought this with the whitmore garment rack because we have moved into a new house with not enough closet space until we can expand the closets i wanted a nicelooking option for storing my clothes this canvas cover is really elegant and lovely looking i am surprised at how much i like it the rack is currently in the home office and it doesnt look terribly out of place if you are out of options for storing your clothes and you simply must use a freestanding rack out in the open i would very much recommend purchasing this rack and coverplease note this is only the cover for the rack there is no garment rack included in this purchase you must purchase the rack separately
ive had a few different digital scales and they have all been excellent cooking companions once you start weighing out ingredients instead of relying on volume alone it is hard to go back it is not only faster but gives more consistent results this scale provided for review by the manufacturer is very similar in style and functionality to others it measures consistently and in more precise increments than most scales that are not much more expensive what distinguishes this scale is how well it is made and how compact it is despite being smaller the pedestal is still large enough to weigh from most bowls the capacity is also good being able to store this unit which has a slim case as well in small spaces drawers cubbies etc is very convenientif i had one critique it would be that this scale would be easier to clean if it had a flat glass surface otherwise i cant think of anything that i would change highly recommended
this is another excellent product i would have been dubious about save for the wonderfully good rating amazons customers gave it the blade doesnt look much at all like a blade and appears to be poorly suited to grind up material placed in the device that is until you see it in action it actually creates a vortex of air and guides the material into the blade causing it to be ground up in quite a quick order i was extremely impressed with how efficient and well this design works i use it daily to grind up toasted flax seeds as well as herbs and other things like dehydrated tomatoesi only wish it wasnt against the directions to use warm soapy water to immerse the bowl of the grinder when washing it if that was listed as acceptable to do it would be pretty much perfect i highly recommend this product
theozera set of silicone baking cup linersare wonderful for muffins cupcakes and more i love to bake cupcakes but if you dont use liners you have a good chance they will stick without cooking spray ive used the paper liners but they just feel so wasteful and can be a pain to remove using these silicone baking cups baking cupcakes has just become much easier for me the remove easy and clean up is a breezewhat i like about these cups is that they can stand up on their own you can use them with a muffin pan or even just on a cookie sheet lots of flexibility i prefer to hand wash them after use but they can be tossed in the dishwasher if thats how youd like to clean up they are also freezer and microwave safe allowing for a range of additional cooking possibilities review sample provided for review and evaluation
i bought one of these for my mom who has a small house with a wall heater in one room but nothing at all in the bedrooms she liked it so much she wanted another one preferring it to the wall heater these are perfect and she especially loves the remote control she can turn it on while still in bed and warm up the room before getting up they are sturdy and compact too so they dont get in the way even in small rooms they are easily moved too which is great if you plan to take it from room to room highly recommended
i still have the first magic bullet ever made i bought it when they first came out several years agoit is only watts yet ive never had an issue with it its done anything ive tried to do with it including making peanut butterive only had to replace the gaskets one time in all these yrs however i dont store the cups with the blades attachedi did think about getting something different but in the end i stuck with getting another mb this time i got the w modelmy original w unit is still working i just wanted something elsethis time i have the blender with is great i dont use the juicer portion as i have a great juicer that uses filters for collecting all the fiber which is great so i dont use the juicer portion of the mbthe magic bullet may not be the best food processor out there however i can use it as a food processor and a smoothie maker plus as i live alone in a very small apt the size of the mb is perfect for mei blend frozen bananas and berries everyday with the mb without an issuethere is a learning curve however i cant simply throw in all frozen fruit and expect it to work it wont especially with bananasi add a liquid which you should do anyway as with all frozen fruit it will be way too thicki mince raw meat and veggies incl sweet potatoes and carrots for the dogs food again adding a splash of water works miraclesif anything ever happens to either of my mbs i will immediately get another without hesitation
i wanted to love this food processor but i couldnt the adjustable slicer feature seems like such a great idea and the large bowl with inserts to make smaller bowls also was a great idea but when you press the start button or the pulse button and all that happens is the light comes on its kinda hard to like it i will say that if you tap it a few times it finally started spinning slowly no power to speak of but to give it a good test i got it spinning and tried to grate some cheese the cheese got stuck under the lid spun around and then popped the lid off while the blade was spinning thanks to amazon for their return policy im sure i got a lemon and maybe a different machine would have worked ok but i ended up getting the extra large cuisinart for xmas and it works perfectly
i had a similar shoe rack but it only had three shelves it has served us well but over time about years it has become wobblier and the white coating was cracking and peeling off we needed more space for shoes anyway so i decided to get this one with one more shelf it was so easy to assemble and looks great inside the house by our door to the garage thats the area where shoes used to pile up and look messy i took off one star because its not wide enough to hold pair of adult shoes without having them overlapping each other if placed side by side normally and it is a little wobbly but sturdy enough that i dont worry about it falling over i dont understand why the people who make these racks dont make them in a width because then three pair of adult shoes would fit much better the racks cant hold anything very heavy without bowing in the middle so if youre thinking of using this for something other than shoes that is heavier than a pair of boots it wont work i dont use this for heels or smaller shoes i use it for sneakers crocks slippers and boots in the winter a good tip i have found that if i lay one pair of shoes on their side like shoes come in a shoe box i am able to fit the two more pairs of shoes flat straight on the rack and they fit perfectly overall im happy with this purchase
this is a good spiralizer if you are looking to either make vegetable pasta noodles or even for curly fries i am rating it four stars instead of five because it is made of plastic and sometimes feels a little wimpy especially when working with harder veggies like sweet potatoes or carrots its been sturdy enough to handle so far but i do feel like i am being cautious and coaxing the veggies into the cutting blade it is also a bit of a pain to clean as there is a sliding component and some vegetable juices drip down into the track but nothing too major once you get the hang of it you can cut mountains of your favorite veggies into spirals pretty quickly fun for kids and grownups be careful though as the blades are very sharp
ight out of the box im impressed ill have to edit after i use it for now heres some information not included anywhere this microwave is volts ac not two way not three way not acdc just plain vac theres a picture on the box over the expression of a speedboat cutting through the water good luck with that one either theres a outlet on board or a transformer converting a volt dc system to vac and pulliing watts i had no expectation of using it with a battery but as small as it is ill bet some consumers have the expectation of using it in a car or rv or boat there is one out there with clips for a volt battery not this oneand laterafter giving it a bench test heres the result first of all things not mentioned in the book it comes with a chromeplated cake rack perfect size to fit on the bottom about by its wires covered in plastic maybe its safe but i will never put metal in a microwave ill save this one for something else but probably toss it out eventually next after you push the start button it may be microwaving but the noticeable fan sound does not begin for seconds and lastly when the clock runs out a lesser fan or slower speed still sounds for about seconds probably to help dry out the condensation from cookingnow for the cooking i usually make instant grits or instant oatmeal in the mornings in a oz paper cup the cup fits fine with maybe an inch to spare in height normally i zap for seconds stir the zap another and the hydration is complete and need to cool for about another minute before eating on this one make that a minute three cookings ive also cooked hamburgers storebought precooked with the same experience if you have time it will do a small job if you want something to take camping many tent sites now have an outlet available look for a small kitchen model which is easy to transport also inexpensiveif you are looking for a small unit to hide at work under your desk etc its fine for warming up coffee or heating up a small meal anything dense like a casserole or the classic baked potato will take some time and patience my rating stays the same
fter almost months of use im happy to report that this stick vac does exactly what its supposed to do and does it very well we have tiles floors through most of our house and cleaning has always been a pain mopping is no trouble picking up the loose dirt is where the hassle comes into play large vacs can have a tendency to throw dirt around rather than picking it up and lets be honest dont we hate the cords and lugging the beast around dust mops are easy to use but like brooms push the dirt around and even after its been scooped up in a dust pan i was still left with that last little pile that wouldnt go into the dust pan no matter nicely i asked or how much i shouted at it i had been using my little hand vac to grab the last of the dirt until it died thats when i ordered this vacthe dirt devil accucharge cordless vac solves all of these problems its exceptionally light in weight very easy to maneuver and has plenty of power to easily pick up dirt and pet hair the dirt container and filter are easy to clean ive used it for about minutes at one time and had no problem with battery drain it sits neatly on its charging base and the accucharge feature should prevent battery burnoutit handles my floor cleaning much faster and easier than either a fullsize corded vac or a dust mopbroom and its light enough to make it my goto solution for little messes after using it for just one month i decided not to replace my hand vac i no longer need it my ship has come in
fter buying a few overpriced cold beverage cups from a certain popular coffee shop i finally wised up and ordered one of these for water and other cold beverages at work this cup is great sturdy looks good and it keeps my ice water cold at work without sweating and getting my desk all wet ive only used it for water so far but the straw has a stirrer thing on the end that would be great for mixing powdered drinks iced coffee tea etc cant beat it for the price i would love a oz version but the oz is still a great sizeeditafter using for about a week now i thought i should point out the cup does sweat not a huge deal but thought i should mention it since i stated that it doesnt in my first review i keep it on a coaster on my desk so its not a problem
i bought one for myself at walmart marked down to i liked it a lot because i keep it in my locker at work and pull it out when i want a single cup of coffeethen i found another one at walmart marked down to i gave it to my sister she absolutely loves hers she uses it for coffee she makes quick hot water for tea cocoa oatmeal etcthen my father found out how much my sister loves her pod brewer so he asked to borrow hersthis one we just bought on amazon was for my father he is so happy with it he loves making only one cup at a time he and my mother no longer use a whole pot of coffee anymore so this pod brewer is just perfect for them the clean up is simple i just pull out the tray dump the used coffee pod in the trash rinse tray under water for a few seconds and leave it to dryi buy the senseo pods for my dad and sister on amazon on a subscription which costs less i even bought the pod filters and make my own pods with my favorite coffee yummmmm if you are the type who will make a pot of coffee this probably isnt for you i drink cups at home before work but every once in a while i want another cup at work and this is perfect for my needs plus it is small and takes up little space you do have to use a mug that will fit under the brew traythe senseo pods that come with the machine are a bit too strong for my tastes but i like weak coffee if i use senseo pods i usually brew the first cup pour it into a larger mug and brew a second cup which waters it down a little closer to my likes it also gives me a bigger cup of coffee for my money based on the many reviews i have read i am probably the only one who thinks the pods are too strong
i am happy with this little pitcher my previous brita deluxe pitcher was years old and i figured it was time for a replacement i like the round shape of the brita classic i dont keep my water in the refrigerator i keep it on my kitchen counter the deluxe pitcher is heavier and actually a bit harder for me to handle with one hand than the classic model the classic also has a smaller footprint on my counter i have very hard water where i live i dont necessarily use the brita to drink water as much as to take out some of the calcium and magnesium salts that destroy so much equipment where i live i use the brita water for cooking pet water my fish tank plants etc i also use bottled water but that can get expensive i am very pleased with my purchase
this knifeset is excellent for the price i have owned my set for years and they are still in great shape the people who gave them a low rating are ignorant star and star the person that gave them a star rating seemed to like them but was comparing them to top shelf knivesif you do not want to care for your knives and throw them in adishwasher buy yourself a set of ginsu knives every few years if youtake care of these knives they will last a long timei coat the wood handels every other month with mineral oil double coat a new set the first time this seals the wood to avoid staining and gives a richer looki also sharpen them as needed with a cheap smiths knife sharpener fine stone only
id seen all the reviews that mentioned this pan bowing up in the middle but i thought id trust the good folks at cooks illustrated instead of the hive mind guess i made a mistake when i received my pan i noticed almost immediately that it was bowed up it was very apparent even before putting oil into the pan which all ran to the sides i thought i could put up with it but i eventually realized that this mean it just doesnt work on my flat electric stovetop heat never really reaches the middle of the pani just heated this pan for minute sat an egg in it watched it slide immediately to the outside then sit and very very slowly turn opaque after minutes i threw the egg out and sat down to write this review will be returning this item immediatelydo not buy this item it is defective quality control is not up to par
thesoehnle siena digital kitchen scaleis one of those devices that doesnt do anything terribly wrong but doesnt really do anything to stand out either it is an allaround mediocre device that can be easily swallowed in the sea of lowend kitchen scalesthe siena tried for a moderately stylish look but fell short with a cheap plastic base theozeri zenithhas a lot more pizzazz with its allstainless frame the ozeri also has a little more room on the platform although neither have the spacesaving convenience of theoxo good gripsand its pullout displaythe siena is fairly affordable as of this writing but there are dozens of options in the range so i wouldnt call it a bargain in fact the wellreceivedweighmax is about half the price and comes with a convenient removable bowlas for accuracy i wouldnt send this scale on a space shuttle mission but itll do just fine in all but the most demanding chefs kitchens the controls werent exactly intuitive but they also didnt require more than a brief glance at the instruction manualat the end of the baking day when its time to put the kitchen tools away the soehnle siena digital kitchen scale will have a place on my shelf but if youre looking to fill a vacancy in your kitchen you may want to keep up the search just a little longer
if youve ever wanted a le creuset cast iron pot but have balked at the price this high quality knock off is the answer two caveats this thing is heavy not necessarily a bad thing but not for weaklings and the lid knob is not plastic like on the more expensive le creuset and gets very hot when used in the oven do yourself and your family a favor if you use the pot in the oven make sure to place a towel or oven mitt over the knob until it cools otherwise this is a fantastic piece of equipment and the persimmon color is simply beautiful great deals like this dont come around often
the big boss pulverizes fruit and veggies in seconds and extracts the juice fully and pours it into the container this was the first time i have used a juicer and was impressed with its speed and strength i was able to put apples directly into the juicer one was two big and i had to cut it in half the juice was excellent it left a little bit of orange pulp go in the juice but it was minimal i think the big boss will satisfy users with the finished product and its capacity for a variety of fruits and veggies of different sizes with the two speeds the big boss takes care of business all you are left with is fresh juice and the clean upi think the big boss requires commitment to the juicing process on account of the clean up required i dont know if it is particular to the big boss but the clean up consists of rinsing six components and scrubbing the filter screen piece to get all the microsize residue off of it the screen cleaning required a firm brush which ought to be included with the product but is not so when you buy this juicer buy a firm cleaning brush too the other items rinse clean easily
fantastic fan one of my meds side effects was feeling excessively hot all the time so i got a stand up fan from the px i dont remember the brand i just know i could never feel any circulating air i even had it standing next to me on high and nothing so i shopped amazon and found two lasko fans both are fantastic they blow harder on the lowest setting then the other on the highest setting i have one in my bedroom and the other in the living room both are about ft from me and work great the sound is not bad on the lowest setting but on the highest setting its like the wind people have heard it in the back ground when im on the phone and have commented when i have company they always comment on how great the fans circulate and i have them both on the lowest setting im glad i found them and will stick to the hvbs in the future thank you lasko for such a great product
why grab a dime first i have found that if i wish to take the stopper apart to wash it it is easier to do so if i insert the coin edge into the approx one inch slot in the top portion of the stopper and pry the two black pieces apart then i remove the oring swish all three parts in hot soapy water rinse them thoroughly dry them and put all three parts back together only takes a few minutes to come up with an uber clean stopperthis order constitutes my second order for a great thermos i ordered my first thermos a couple years ago and have used it for juice or coffee as part of my am breakfast routine because the item has proven to be perfect for my needs i am ordering this second thermos i like to prepare the coffee and juice just before going to bed and awaken in the morning to cold juice and hot coffee awaiting me at my desk i am more like a zombie when i get up in the morning and my thermos routine has become a necessitythe brew stays hot over night because i first prepare the thermos with boiling hot water from the microwave and i place the thermos that has the hot beverage in an insulated bag to help the contents remain hoti also have a longhandled bottle brush for scrubbing out my twin thermos containers after each use highly recommended
the propressors stainless steel look is sleek and attractive having never used a garlic press before i was not exactly sure what to expect but it was extremely easy to use and very effective at chopping up garlic the mincer is heavy duty and built to last since i only need to mince garlic on a rare occasion i cant foresee ever needing to replace this gadget it did require me to use both hands to but through the garlic but i did not have any difficulty i could not exactly get away with not touch the garlic at all as it does stick a bit to the press but it was certainly better than having to mince it all by hand clean up was extremely easy and running the basket under water did the trick i am very happy with the propressor and am thrilled that i will no longer have to mince garlic by hand
this is just awesome no more stops at mickey ds on the way to work you can drop the eggs in put the meat on the warmer drop the muffis and take a shower when you get out you can grab your food with a cup of coffee and start your morning rightvery easy to keep clean cooks the eggs perfectly i read a review where ppl were complaining the toast was not dark enough the dial on this toaster is backwards from most you dont go clockwise for the dark settings you go counter clock wise once i figured that out i was even more impressed it does take a bit os space but is so worth it the kids can fix their own eggs and toast now that is a winner in my book
this mattress is quite firm not incredibly so but still very comfortable just dont expect to sink into this mattressi have only used this mattress for months so i dont know about longterm durability when i first got the mattress it did have a sort of funky smell i after it had risen completely i let it air out for a few days before i started using it it still had a lingering smell for a few days but was not all that noticeablethere are cheaper and more expensive options out there regardless i am happy with this mattressone thing to note if you have the ikea bed frame it will stretch it out i would recommend a sturdy bed frame
this is the best heater hands down it is easy to use does what is says it will do and is energy efficient it gets very hot on low and the range of motion with the low swing oscillation is great it is quiet and the best part is no blowing air and it adds a nice glow to a room when i set the timer the heat remains for a long time after it shuts off i researched purchasedreturned and used almost every type of heater from the vornado to a holmesthis one is the bestit is a keeper
i purchased this honing steel to keep my new set of victorinox knives in the best condition possible i highly recommend this product and have since purchased an additional one for my parents kitchen back homemy cooking friends recommended that i get a steel at least longer than the longest knife i planned to use it with i purchased thevictorinox inch chefs knife black fibrox handleat the same time so i opted for this steel over the less expensive or steels available elsewhere i am very satisfied with this decision as this steel is sufficiently long to hone all of my knives with easethis steel is regular cut which has a surface that is intermediate in roughness between a coarse cut and a smooth polishedvictorinox honing steel inch round smooth polish black plastic handlesteel while a diamond steel such asvictorinox diamond honing steel inch oval with solid core black plastic handleis intended to remove metal and offer rudimentary sharpening capabilities a honing steel such as this is designed only to realign the microscopic edge of the blade which becomes folded over with use a regularcut honing steel like this is almost certainly what you want diamond steels increase the rate of wear on a knife and can easily ruin the cutting edge with improper techniquewhen done correctly this realignment significantly improves the cutting performance and prevents damage and pitting to the cutting edge maintaining the knives between sharpenings while sharpening might only be performed every year or so honing should be performed before each time the knife is used this procedure only takes a few seconds a quick internet search will show you how to do it and makes a huge difference to the utility and longevity of your knivesthe most dangerous tool in the kitchen is definitely a dull knife whether your knives are stamped or forged a quality steel is a great investment that will keep them cutting like new
nly had this for two months its lightweight compact and easy to clean i am a bit concerned about all the detachable plastic material im just not sure if it will withstand the long haul especially since i move around a lot i can imagine one of the plastic pieces breaking in the future it is also a bit spendy for a vacuum plus im not that impressed with the suction reading all the dramatic reviews about older people not being able to move it on carpet i thought it would be equivalent to my shop vac but no its a little better than the average vacuum though
t it be said that this thing is huge i knew it was going to be big i even knew the steamer was across i just didnt realize what that was going to look like in real life somewhat different than holding a ruler across with that said i am very pleased its as big as it is because i have a lot of steaming i do my poor old dog is allergic to commercial dog foods so i steam yams for her and was doing it seemingly constantly with my little basket steamer and when i was steaming for her i couldnt for us i had to do it in two batches so now i can steam everything all at once i am thrilled that the casserole can also double as a stock pot i make a lot of soup during the colder months and i just love the size and shape of this its bigger than the pan ive been using so ill be able to make a little more as well not to mention its oven safe so i can make my famous vegetable timbale and have more leftovers i lucked out that the lid perfectly fits one of my favorite frying pans that didnt come with a lid and ive not been able to find one anywhere its true when you pick up the lid water streams off of it so when i pick up the lid i just hold it over the pot until that stops pretty simple and cleanup is a breeze i dont think i could love this any more than i do and if i could give it even more stars i would
first of all this is really meant for office usage this means if you use computer for typing documents organize your daily routine as the picture shown the computer screen is about in max to fit on the table installation is such pain took me hrs to complete because of so many component however instruction is crystal clear which is very rare these days its very sturdy certain components can be uninstalled which make them optional that is pretty good overall design is ok i was stupid to use this desk for gaming not a good choice it has years warranty and i paid for it since i use no rush delivery and if it indeed lasts more than years i am a very happy person
this toaster oven has everything you think you want in a countertop appliance yes its a little big but you overlook it based on the front interface and the convectionsadly the coollooking metal handle is too close to the glass so while the heat is conducting through the oven to the handle you end up brushing your knuckles against the door while opening it or well i did several times until i realized that one day my young son or some unsuspecting guest was going to try to make toast and end up burnedreplaced this one with the cuisinart tob classic toaster oven broiler brushed stainless and black and love it
i purchased this coffee maker to replace my wornout nespresso essenza c i love the sleek look of this new design plus the addition of the aeroccino on the same platform it took a few days to become accustomed to the new sleep mode but in this age of green thinking it made sense the unit is so easy to keep clean and i like where the aeroccino inserts are stored easily accessible under the metal grid plate the aeroccino can froth hot or cold milk it too is stateoftheart btw ordering coffee capsules from nespresso is a breeze with fast shipping try some of their special edition flavours
nly used times and for days so dont know how reliable it will be but so far i love it its much quieter than my upright vacuum and doesnt scare the cats one likes to follow it around super easy to use right now i have carpet and hard surface floors and it has no trouble making the transition my couch and bed have skirts and i wasnt sure what would happen it doesnt try to go through the skirts so i have to tuck the skirts up if i want it to go under those pieces but it also doesnt get stuck on them so thats ok amazing how it navigates around and through the kitchen chairs the messages on the screen just make it adorableupdate june still going strong
i live with three hungry boys i love to cook in bulk and freeze for later if you have a large family or a family with large appetitesthis pan is for you before i switched to stainless i used the cuisinart quart non stick pan very similar to this if i wanted to cook lbs of meat it would end up overflowing before i could add the saucethis quart size is perfect for cooking lbs or more of meat and adding veggies and sauces it can get very heavy which is where the wonderful helper handle shines ive never had a problem with either handle getting too hot you only need to cook over a low setting as this pan will heat up very quickly no need to the pan eggs will stick slightly but they come right up after a good soak this pan has good weight to it it will not wibble wobble all over the stove like aluminum pans dothe wonderful nodrip lid really doesnt drip the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess this lid will suction slightly to my cooktop i will take that over a wet mess overall a wonderful pan cooks the food quickly and evenly no toxic nonstick chemicals are going into our food what more can a busy mom ask for
y i feel such mixed feelings for something so great as a water carbonator cuisinart remains one of the most reputable brands when it comes to kitchen appliances you would think they would nail it like they have so many other timeson its face it is a great machine small and compact it will take less space in your kitchen than your toaster assembly is minimal the co tank fits snuggly carbonating your water takes only a few seconds of time to get it right and well it does the job club soda every day i love ithowever i have to repeat what so many other reviews state the c cartridge is small good luck getting the suggested uses out of it furthermore the cartridge is far too expensive to keep this habit up daily or even weekly thats a huge downer for such a smoothly designed product only water bottle is a sad move to pull on the customer so you cant have one waiting in tow for when you are out the design is great yet all these negatives add up fast it makes me think cuisinart is trying to make a killing off their name alonemaybe good for your cocktails but if you want soda every day look elsewhere
ive bought a lot of these umbra frames in different sizes they tend to be about half the price on amazon than what they are at my local art supply stores theyre pretty much the best bang for the buck ive found dont worry about damage in shipping like broken glass amazon overcompensates i bought a bunch of x frames and the boxes were gigantic the frame was packed in its normal packaging and put in a amazon box using filler that box in turn was put inside a larger amazon box once again surrounded by fillerthe frames are well made they dont look like something youd find in wally world the ones with two pieces of glass are supposed to make it look like the photo is floating in space keep in mind that your wall shows through so that your wall color becomes your matte color i did fit a matte into of mine just needs to be the same size as a piece of the glass and its easy that also gave me the added advantage of having extra pieces of glass i used to replace other cracked or broken pieces still need some more moving killed me i want to paint my picture wall dark green but that will mean matting all of the floater frames i havei need to buy a bunch more frames to create another picture wall ill get some of the european clip frames because they are really cheap but ill buy a variety of umbra frames for my better work
i havent used this for potatoes just apples and even though i dont use it all that oftenjust a few times per year when i make apple pies cobblers and the likeit is an indispensible piece of kitchen equipment all you have to do is stick the apple on the prongs and turn the handle as the apple spins it is peeled by the sharp little blade and as it passes through the little opening on the end it is cored and sliced into a neat even spiral its practically effortless the suction cup is a nice added feature for holding the unit still as you are using it i would definitely recommend this item and its an absolutely musthave if you are frequently baking apple treats
this thing is heavy my boyfriend had trouble even getting it in the house it truly is a itemassembly took about a hour but was pretty simple the instructions arent stellar but theyre passable the item looks a little nicer than some of the previous entertainment centerstv stands weve had the dark brown is classylooking even if it is particleboardthe tv stand is a little lower than id like but well managei like the silver legs another little detail that makes this item a little nicer than mostplenty of storage too we have our wii dvd player and laptop stored below along with some dvds and cablesno real complaints here for the price its a nice item
oxo clips are great they are sturdy virtually unbreakable and have magnets on them so that you can stick them to the refrig or theyll stick together in a part of your draweri use them for everything ive stopped using those chip clips which slide off and you also have to fiddle with them to get them on someone mentioned binder clipsyes but they are harder to get on and off ugly and very tight sometimes you want a clip that holds things together well but doesnt crush themthis is hard to explain but ill just say that i find the amount of tension on the oxo clips idealoxo makes easytouse real handy products and i have never been disappointed in any of them at this price you can afford to try the clips out youll probably want to buy moregreat buy
the item looks great it arrived as ordered why did i give it a poor review because the top hole in the bracket is aligned with the curved bar that has the hook for the tendrils you will not be able to screw it in straight with a normal drill and screw bit so far i have been unable to install it securely this aspect is poorly designed and is not worth a great rating if they redesign it and put the factory made hole above the top part of the curve i would give it a much better rating
decided to pick up a set of these mostly because the price on amazon was so goodi used them right away to make zucchini bread they are absolutely wonderful i already added another set to my cart because just wasnt quite enough with the recipe i havei read that some buyers stated they are hard to clean i didnt have any problem with anything getting stuck in the seams i did used a non stick spray pam in them so that might make a differencei keep a toothbrush in the kitchen exclusively for dishes and if something along the way might stick i am sure this will solve that problemi love this particular brand and dont see at this price you can go wrong with these they are sturdy where i have had some that were thin and flimsy but not these they are a good quality with some weight to them i am extremely pleased
s many other users here ive purchased a number of these canisters and they all seem to eventually get cracks ive tried to treat them with kid gloves not putting them in the dishwasher being careful not to overseal them etc doesnt matter some crack even after just a few uses i have one tall one that still seems to be okay and the square marinator but these round canisters are just very unreliable with all the complaints im surprised there hasnt been a class action suit against the company for knowingly continuing to sell such defective products i now generally use medium and large mason jars and seal them with the handheld unit and jar sealers this works so much better but has limited space of course even with larger jars its a shame tilia cant get their act together and make canisters that will last
i would have given this five stars except one thing this is going to be a challenge to clean i have not yet attempted it and it needs it i can see white dust around every vent opening building up now for the great we have used this every night for two years in the bedroom with door closed we need the white noise because we live along a busy highway and a train track crossing whistle blowing but also to help with clean air and for that extra breeze sometimes needed all year long its also attractive it sits in the corner of the room and is set each night so it will not revolve though you can have that if you desire
i used this on a recent trip and it performed flawlessly i got a full nights bedside humidifying from a half liter bottle of water in my hotel roombasically you take a standard bottle of water plug in a special adaptor into the mouth then turn it upside down on the humidifier using bottled water instead of a reservoir makes this humidifer small and perfect for travelmy biggest worry is the adaptor there is no place on the humidifer to securely store it if lost the entire humidifier becomes useless if the manufacturer reads these reviews i would suggest a secure slot somewhere on the humidifer to store the bottle adaptor
it puts out a cloud of water vapor and its not all that noisy but i had no idea id be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart wiping it down trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down refilling the tank twice a day and wondering why this humidifier doesnt have an automatic shuftoff in case i forget to turn it off at least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find however this is too much like an unwanted hobby so ill be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room
i ordered a twin and mailed to family i was going to visit whose beds are too hard for me my sister was coming and she has rheumatoid arthritis and needs a foam type topper to reduce pressure points both of slept on it and what a difference took a fairly miserable hard twin bed experience and made it actually comfortable its so good im going to order one or more for homei just got this a month or so i dont know how the wear and durability will be they all seem to degrade over time but so far i am very very impressed
i love this oven you can reheat fried foods with the convection oven to get things nice crispy instead of soggy like a microwave in fact it is good enough to fry without oil such as spraying sliced potatoes with pam then convectioning them until they are crisp outside tender insidethe rotiserie is a little small it only holds pounds and you need good cotten string to tie wings anything else that may flop when turning but the food comes out a nice golden brown while being juicy insidehowever you can sit a pound roast on top of the roasting rack and still have vegetables in the roasting traythe pizza tray also works well with cookies but make sure you flatten the pizza dough just before cooking if you plan to use the convection setting instead of the bake setting since it makes breads rise higher as well as cook fastermy only complaint was the instruction manual having been advertised as having a feature at sams it didnt have instructions for making toast i called the help number learned that after preheating for minutes you can broil bread on the top shelf for minutes turn over cook another minutes for toast you seem to need to preheat the oven for minutes for most cooking tasks the outside of the oven becomes hot enough to melt plastic left on it while cooking so only set metal on top of it like its accessories
i got this to protect my mattress after my kitty got sick it works it protected my mattress from accidents and it fit the mattress queen size pillowtop perfectly i was looking for one that was not going to make me sweat to death while trying to sleep and i was very impressed the very first night i noticed that i was actually cooler sleeping on it than sleeping with only a sheet between myself and the mattress it even made the sheet stay put better instead of it pulling off as i turned over in bed no crinkly plastic feel or noise and cooler more comfortable sleep im going to get the pillowcases next
i already have a memory foam mattress so i know what to expect and this did not disappoint i was sleeping on a a temporary mattress and it was hard i got up several times during the night once i put this topper on it i sleep all the way through and i just love the feel of the product as i am lying down just enough firmness and just enough flexibility i didnt notice any strong odors and i used it straight out of the box my first nighta definite recommend if you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to a memory foam mattress keep in mind though that the underlying mattress shoudl be of a good quality and not sagging also in my opionion this topper is too hard to place directly on the floor or on a hard mattress foundation it definitely needs to go on top of a mattress but then again thats why its called a topper
if you check with your local sams club you might get it for the low price of as i did yesterday it even came with a free days supply of superfood superboost in a pouch i also googled our local target jc penny and bath bed and beyond and they all carry it for i made my first batch of smoothie yesterday and oh my it was delicious the only thing i do not know its not written in their little booklet is if i have to use the milling blade first to brake down pulverize flex seeds and or other seeds and nuts when added to the mix or do the seeds go in with the greens and fruits together and will the extracting blade pulverize them would someone please be so kind let me know i also found bunch of very promising smoothie recipe on the internet coffee flavored chocolate flavored cacao flavored etc with all natural ingredients i am sooo very happy and thankful for all the great reviews that helped me to make up my mind to purchase this wonderful blendermixer life is good
i often bake cheesecakes and brownies and thekuhn rikon pushpanmakes presentation simple and easy this pan combines the ridgy of a solid metal baking pan with a false bottom that separates from the sides when you press the sides down the silicone ring around the bottom creates a great seal and gives me confidence there will be no spills in the oveni love this pan over a typical baking pan because it really allows me to better present baked goods with out destroying the presentation getting them out of a regular pan i have found this pan perfect for cakes and ill even occasionally make round brownies in this pan simply wonderful
i have the spoon holder that lays on the counter and you have to wash it just like if you put it straight on the counter i like this because it goes on any pan and it only drips into the pan the bad it if you have a lid you have no place to put it you can also use it for notes etc so thats a pluswell i have used it a few times and i am not so pleased the spoon falls off and it makes more of a mess then wiping the counter but the good thing it still is good for putting notes on the fridg
i had bought some other pilsner type glasses from amazon recently anchor hocking grand pilsner barware set that looked tall in the picture but were short with a wide rim diameter its hard to savor my beer in a glass that has a rim it feels like im sipping my expensive beer out of a jar to me a diameter rim is more suited for eating and drinking beer at a meal not sipping and savoring a fine beerthis beer glass is elegant in design isnt fragile as some have said and just has the look and feel of a glass youd want to pour an expensive bottle of beer into if youre looking to purchase any pilsner beer glass always check the rim diameter in my opinion diameter rims are too wide for sipping and savoring a fine beer
this is the third floor steamer i have purchased over the years i gave to wanting something that looked easier to use so i went with this and it is easy to use but it does not work the way a steamer should you have to have holding tank that can heat to boiling in order to get true steam cleaning you need to see steam come out this just seams to heat the pad with hot water which you then wipe over your floor it leaves water that has to dry my prior steam cleaners would pratically be dry seconds after you stopped i could do a section of a floor and then put the furniture back right away this one i had to actually wait for minutes or more before i could replace the furniture i do not dare use this again on my sealed wood floor due to how much moisture it leaves behind if you want something what works correctly you need to wait the minutes for it to heat up before you use it a second time that is well worth the wait rather than waiting for it to dry after you have used it if i had only had vinyl floors i might be okay with this especially if i was going from a mop to this having used other steamers that really used steam this is a joke and a total waste of money i should have known better than to go for convenience over getting the job done right
t least for the table if im breaking down a lobster in the kitchen then ill simply use the back of a heavy chefs knife note that any lobster over lb will require a hammer not a cracker lb and up a hand maul however all this only applies to the claws the tail even of a large lobster doesnt require a tool of any kindthis cracker is lightweight easy to use with buttery hands and with its red color its easy to find at an outdoor picnic be careful of most crackers as many are either useless or difficult to use one that particularly comes to mind is a stupid design in the shape of a lobster claw sure its really cuteuntil you actually try to use them which when you find out they cut into your hands at the slightest pressuresince most restaurants have chintzy tools when eating out in nyc id bring my own zyliss cracker and a global seafood pick the best ones out there along with a pair of joyce chen scissors however if you dont want to drop the for the global then zyliss makes a decent set of picks the part to pay attention to is the some brands are so smooth as to be uselessyoull find that a good set of picks are only minimally useful on lobster mostly the joints but theyre essential for king or snow crab even maryland crabfyi most people who live outside new england are at a loss at how to take a lobster apart more expensive restaurants will do it for you but wheres the fun in that instead check you tube for videos on how to do it there are a bunch now i just have to decide how to best take advantage of my chain supermarket lobster sale lb
these scoop well and they do sit flat on the counter for the most part to measure liquid if neededother than this i am very disappointed firstthe ez grip is not a selling point for me or anyone else i know as having a measuring cup just slip out of your hands while cooking just doesnt happen anyone out there please correct me if i am wrong on that one secondly there is no way to hang these up or hook them together as they have no hole in the end of them they end up all over my accessory drawer upside down and right side upwhat a mess this might not be such a big deal but as i get to the third problemyou seethe label of what the scoop size is is so small i have to either go get my glasses in the middle of my cooking endeavor or have someone else who might be in the kitchen read it for me if you look closely in the picture they stamped the size in very small print just below those ez grip handles on the very edge of the white plastic really norpro you shouldnt have taken up so much space for probably the most important part of the measuring scoop itselfthe part that does the measuring
i received the breadmaker and when i was taking it out of the box i noticed something rattling inside the bread maker i noticed that there was a chinese qc passed sticker on the bottom of the machine great job guysi tried to take the bottom off the breadmaker but it wont come off i guess that i will have to leave the loose screw or whatever it is inside until it shorts out the electrical components its not worth the shipping to return it for a new one i was hoping for a little better quality for a bread machine
this cast iron grill pan is in wide and has an odd shape that is neither round nor square but which works well for the purposefor many decades i have used one noname in cast iron skillet that is in deep for cooking just about everything that doesnt need to go in a pot i it from my mother when i left home and it lives on top of my stove its lid will fit on top of this pan and prevents most splatteringcast iron is the best material for many kinds of cooking and so it has made a renaissance in the past few years the newest cast iron is mostly preseasoned but it is really just a light coating to prevent it from rusting before it gets to the consumer it still needs to be used for a while before it is truly seasoned i have just been oiling this grill pan well before use and havent bothered to grease and bake it in an effort to fully season itthe pan does a good job putting grill marks on food i dont worry too much about fat intake but it would be useful for cooking meats without having them sit in and absorb too much fat it also can be used in the oven as the ridges allow air to circulate and it makes a nice garlic breadthis pan does have a roughish pebbled texture like all the new cast iron does the older cast iron from before world war ii has a much smoother finish this is not a problem for a grill pan like it would be with a skilletthe handle on this pan is nice and chubby and easy to grab it even has raised thumb grips
i wasnt looking for a work of art in a percolator i just wanted to make absolutely sure that i could still have coffee if i got hit by a hurricane or tropical storm again for those of us who like our morning coffee is there really any way to make a poststorm morning worse why yes there isno coffeeso after a fairly short search i chose this one i was fully prepared to have this be only the first one in a series before i was satisfied but it seems i made the right choice in one try despite this pot being far less than the highest end one available it is exceptionally well made thick steel very nice finish bottom seam is super tight and the handle very sturdy the filter and stem fit tightly and are easily placed and removed meaning no annoying jingling while perkingif you havent had percolator coffee you really should give it a try it is like the difference between gravy made by running water over a turkey and gravy made from the drippings of the turkey if i can use such an example the richness the full range of flavors and even the color make it a very worthy use of a few extra minutes of time waitingi use mine on a ceramic cooktop and have had no problems i also used it on the burner on my grill with no discoloration though i did use the burner plate so to keep the flames from directly touching it much had to do the posthurricane testing overall id have to say this is one of my favorite appliance purchases so far and far from waiting until a hurricane makes me use it i now enjoy my coffee on the weekends made the slightly slower but far more delicious way
i bought this cuisinart greengourment pan on amazoncom i saved with buying it on amazon this is one of the nicest non stick pans that i have ever owned i started cooking years ago i love the way it cooks every thing you do not need any oil at all out of habit i think i do use my olive oil mister for certain veggies and white fish i would recommend this pan hands down plus it is a healthy way too cook my husband even made a comment on how he enjoys using this pan when he cooks his eggs he never comments on anything unless it is great it sure has made a difference for him he know cooks some food for himself i love thisladys introduce your hubbys or partners to this pan who knows they may just cook a meal
this dinnerware set has a nice classic style and design and is quite functional in daily use they are porcelain which i think gives them an elegant feel they are medium weight i would say compared to stoneware which is heavier all of the pieces are of a good size and deep enough for food with gravy or sauces pasta dishes and so on i like the bowls especially but all are good and compliment each other wellthe pattern is bright and cheerful the pieces seem well made and durable the picture here is representative and accurate all in all i like them for the price i wish it were six place settings but if you can catch them on sale the value proposition is better this is a good solid set and should hold up well in daily use so if you like the pattern and style i think you will be satisfied with themi think this set would make a nice gift item for a new couple starting out as a gift the deen might be worth the extra premium you are paying in making these a bit more special to your recipient
i bought this steamer after deciding to make my own baby food and realizing that the steamer that goes with my pot set was i researched a couple of steamers and this one seemed to have the best reviews and fit my needs and i have not been disappointed it fits in my larger pot was too big for the small and medium pot but folds up nicely when i am not using it so far i have steamed peas carrots and squash and all of them have come out great it is easy to clean even after i accidently burned the bottom i highly recommend this steamer if you are looking for one that goes with any pot set and dont want to spend a crazy amount of money
i wrote in another review that i have been upgrading to wilton products over the years after having to toss other baking pans i recently got this mini muffin pan and love it very easy clean up and once you get the hang of the small portions it is so fun to use i have made cupcakes muffins and brownie bitesvery perfect size for people to just eat a little something my next projects will be little cheesecakes quiches and stuffed mushroomsthere are also tons of cute papers you can buy for these with themes for various holidays or just save money and buy the plain white i have used and enjoyed this more than i thought i would and highly recommend it ps if you have amazon prime this ships free another huge plus for people who dont live near a store that carries specialty items
i bought this to make ice cream at home bc my son is on a gluten and casein free diet it is too expesnive to go to the health food store and buy him ice cream everytime he wants some this machine is great i can put the ingredients in we can sit down to eat once our meal is done the ice cream is ready it tastes so much better than store bought the book is great but i also purchase a couple other books when i bought this i kept only one bc it had recipes for gfcf icecream in it
i own many cuisinart products and was excited to find this item i readily purchased it from bed bath beyond the excitement ended there the first time i used it it leaked oil everywhere the lid while looks pretty is a terrible design it hangs over the edge of the pan so as oil splatters up on the sides of the lid it drips down the sides of the base not good the lid fogs up really quick and you dont see much so the fact that its clear doesnt help any they need to redesign the venting at the top to allow more air to flow faster so that the lid doesnt fog up the heating pan is also a bad design the stirring arm motor is too weak and towards the end of the popping cycle it will not stir the corn so youll get some burnt at the end also the pan has ridges all around the edge which match the lid design so uncooked kernels find refuge here and dont pop again bad design ive used it about a dozen times and i havent had anything break such as the handle locks as others have reported but its a mess to clean up due to bad lidbase designso since i was disappointed i began my hunt again for another popper i found the westbend kettle krazy and bought it from amazon thinking hopefully the design is better it arrived and i quickly washed it and set it up i immediately noticed that the lid atleast fits inside the pan thank goodness i knew the dripping oil wouldnt be an issue anymore i popped my first batch and it was amazing i couldnt believe how different the two units functioned the pan shape is so much better and the stirring arm is very strong and i think it would stir through anything i then made kettle corn yes thats right kettle corn just like youd get at the local fair tbs corn oil c mushroom kernels sugar add oil let heat for min add kernels when first kernel pops add sugar sprinkling evenly over kernels and quickly replace lid once popped salt to taste and shake to mix there you have it perfect kettle corn i tried this in the cuisinart and it just burnt mainly because the stirring arm motor isnt very strong and made a mess it also was hard to clean the lid the cooking pan but the westbend performed like a champ there was almost no clean up at all the teflon coating on the pan is amazing and nothing sticks to it the coating on the easypop sucks and sticking is inevitablego with the westbend kettle krazy youll be glad that you did
i purchased this in november after my hoover bagless quit picking anything up even with all new filters and a good cleaning i love this eureka even though it is heavy and a little difficult to use on my toomany steps this is the best sweeper ive ever used i had a piece of material that had fallen went to pick it up with the hose in my other hand and the hose actually sucked it up before i could get to it i was amazed my hoover wouldnt have even moved the piece of material my only is that i wish the hose was longer the foot lever does have to be pushed just right to get the handle lowered but i like this better than other sweepers ive had where the handle comes down too easily and doesnt stay as secure when using the hose i have serious yearround allergies and have found this bag is much better than the bagless i used to have i have recommened this sweeper to everyone i know
were using it to hold bags of chips and snacks that always seemed to find their way on our counters its wire construction so its easy to see the snacks on the shelves it was pretty easy to assemble takes about minutes as everyone has said dont place heavy items on the cart also the wheels look like wheels and thats about it for those things i dont think they are rolling when i push it on our hardwood floor i think theyre just sliding i also dont think they would roll even if on shallow carpet definitely wont work well if you have thick shaggy carpet the wheels probably would get stuck and the cart would probably topple over they are attached off to the side of the wheel with a swivel but the swivel doesnt rotate well so the wheels just slide around without facing correctly to movement definitely has no bearings if it did it wouldnt be just i wouldnt place heavy items on the bottom to make the wheels or the swivel work better youll probably end up breaking the attachment because its made of cheap thin plastic still cheap wheels that dont work properly the cart does its job of holding our snacks and clearing off our kitchen counters and it doesnt look too badit stands inches to the upper barhandle the baskets are inches wide inches long and deep inside dimensions they are spaced at to inches from bottom of basket to bottom of basket wire sides are spaced at inch apart if you were thinking of placing it in a small nook the space will need to be at least inches wide by inches deep by inches high
these towels are bamboo like some plastic spoons are corn the plant material has been processed into a plastic to produce viscose rayon fiber so essentially these are much like polyester towels where the originating material is bamboo rather than petroleumbut thats not really what matters are they nice towels well mostlytheyre very silky and substantial they dont absorbent but they dry me off just fine they have a very heavy limp drape but at the same time they get wrinkled in the dryer easily and the wrinkles stay does anyone iron towels in general id like to say these feel really luxurious but the machine my particular set was made on had some issues there are pulled threads and hanging strands if they were perfectly made yes theyd feel like something from a swanky hotel but not flawed like this i dont know if all towels will have the same issue though it still dries just fine of courseone interesting thing to note is if you have curly or frizzy hair you probably know that its a bad idea to use cotton terrycloth towels on it those make the frizziness worse however these bamboo viscose towels do not have the same problem which is nice overall recommended with some minor reservations
this kitchen aid can opener with a magnet for removing lids met my expectations and thats a relief considering some of the mixed reviews ive read true this can opener has what feel like somewhat cheaply made soft handles but on the other hand the soft handles on this can opener do make it easier to hold onto it while im opening a can and thats a plusoverall id say this is a very good basic can opener especially for people who dont want an electric can opener or for people on a budget who still want a good can opener ive used it for a while now without any problems i recommend it
i was uncertain about this coffee maker as the choice of the size of the cups was so small but i found that when paired together with a ounce travel mug i like my coffee to stay hot it was perfect for my needs i have cups in the morning and in the afternoon and it is perfect for me with my old coffee maker i made enough for ounce cups at a time and sometimes threw away what was left in the cup also the coffee did not taste nearly as good now i have no waste just one perfect cup of coffee at a time plus it is so easy to use i looked at the directions once and that was it i knew how to use it it is very userfriendly
fred schneider said it best hot pants flare up and this little fan does a terrific job in managing the intermittent waves of heat emanating from my face neck chest back everywhere this little fan minimizes the sensation of feeling like youre in the midst of a stagnant wave of excessive heat and humidity it adds just enough coolness from a strong micro breeze and air circulation to make menopause nearly tolerablelets face it there are a whole lot of you who are searching for a pocketsized fan to deal with hot flashes thats how i found this thing i bought two of them one for home one for work assuming theyd be okay theyre definitely okay theyre terrific you cant even accidentally hack off a finger tip because the fan blades are made of foam i have one on the end table aside of my end of the sofa and the other is in my top desk drawer at work always ready for that surprise attack of heatthis little fan is incredibly good i ordered two they sent me two different colors how nice was that
s i look at most of the negative reviews its hard to not notice that they come from prior users who upgraded or replaced a machine that simply wore out my first foodsaver lasted more than years was frequently used and performed well this by comparison is simply awful it wastes unacceptable percentages of the bag for even simple tasks like the first seal and it provides a well sealed and vacuumed product less than half the time its slow noisy inefficient at rd more cost than my prior machine as a design matures it should become more reliable this went the other way ill be returning the machine and buying a manual model with better reviews making something automatic frequently simply adds to the complication level at the expense of reliability i think this is a perfect example of that
i really like pizza all of the pizza places in my home town charge way too much for way too little this delightful gadget has changed my pizza buying habits i now load up on frozen pizza sauce stuffed crust cheese stuffed crust rising crust or thin crustadd lots of extras from feta cheese to pineapple and in less than half an hour have a delicious pizza that is crispy on the bottom bubbly on the top and hot all the way throughi have owned my pizza maker for a year and it has never failed me if you love pizza buy one now use it at once also simple to clean i now use my pizza stone for decoration
got this pan as a replacement for a year old aluminumbased calphalon pan of the same size due to many disrespectful room mates in the past it was just too scratched to continue using itive had this thing for close to a year now its still amazingly slick and as such its the easiest piece of cookware i own right now its steel handle is convenient for being ovensafe for things like frittata but it can get a little warm down by the base of the connection the handles curved shape took a little getting used to as i havent owned any allclad before but i quickly got used to iti havent seen any evidence toward warping yet but i do keep temperature in mind i got a allclad stainless pan in the same purchase and i use that anytime really high heat is necessary or if i plan on building a pan sauceits a lot of money but its a lot of pan if an old calphalon pan lasted me years i have every confidence that this will last me many years
first off yes its noisy but what do we expect a silent device that magically cleans up i think noti got this from a rewards program at work and i love it so much i would probably pay retail for it if i had toi have two cats and dark nearly black hardwood floors i just sweep everything into the corner minute and grab my dirtdevil and in a few seconds suck up the pile of hair cat food litter dirt dust and whatnot that once covered my floor sucks it all up in one try no fussalso worked great aropund the edges of the kitchen and stairs where dust seems to accumulateso for its size it does seem slightly noisy thus just stars but if you can live with that this will be quick and fast and worth it
i have searched and read reviews on dozens of sheets and sheet sets i also wanted to know the size i was getting this set was one of the best priced for count egyptian cotton sheets i have found they are very generous in size the flat queen is larger than normal so your mate and you can roll over and still be covered the pillow cases are two inches larger than normal queen usually standard size pillow cases are what you get the stitching detail is perfection and classyi washed them before use in cold water there was zero color released in the water i dried on delicate i bought slate color too so i was very please with everything about the quality pleasantly surprised they have just the right body and weight to the sheet im so please with these i am ordering another set and extra pillow casesi wouldnt buy anything else now
there are many things i like about this kettle i was afraid the handle over the opening would make it difficult to fill but it has never been a problem the toggle switch lights up with it is on and the kettle shuts itself off when the water is boiling sometimes it shuts itself off when i pour out the water and sometimes it stays on so that is continues to boil when i put it back on its stand this concerned me at first but ive found if it is still on when i set it back on the stand it will shut itself off as soon as the water starts boiling again i like its retro look and am very happy with its introduction into my kitchen
i cant drink plain water anymore this makes a fruity light tasting water that i can drink all day i use all types of fruits when you use the additives like mio or crystal light it leaves an aftertaste unless the water is ice cold this you can drink at room temp with no problem i have been trying to drink more water every day as i age i find i feel so much better i was never one to drink a lot of water but now with the flavoring i can drink it without even thinking about it these pitchers are so well made and heavy duty they clean up fast and easy for reuse i highly recommend these pitchers
ive been so envious of my sister in laws collection of le creuset cast iron and finally decided to splurge on a dutch oven but then i came across the lodge dutch oven and decided to give it a try for the price i had little to lose the pot arrived yesterday and i seasoned it based on others comments i used it today to make chicken cacciatore which not only turned out perfectly and none of the chicken stuck during browning but clean up was a breeze i just scraped out the gunk washed in clear hot water towel dried and coated with vegetable oil i usually use a calphalon professional dutch oven and it requires lots of scrubbing so this was a really nice change i had not cooked in cast iron for years and this was such a positive experience that ive already ordered the qt pro logic dutch oven
i love this grill pan i purchased for under so it was a very good bargain i use this pan on a smooth top electric stove and it works perfectly it heats and cooks evenly great grill marks on chicken and burgers careful when washing it because it does hold the heat for some time after you take it off the burner i have found that taking a paper towel and wiping out the grease while it is still hot makes it easier to wash after it has cooled off i have had this pan for about a year and use it or times a week i agree with the reviewer who likes this pan better than the george foreman grill the quality of this pan is superb and an excellent value at this price you will not be disappointed
fter almost years of buying the vacuum cleaners from local discount stores my wife and i decided we would go ahead and take the plunge and purchase a dyson since most of our other vacuums lasted on average about years we calculated that we had spent well over on past vacuums and none of them really worked that well we received our dyson about a year ago just after a new years party we had and after the cleanup with trash pickup mopping and vacuuming thought everything was fairly clean we had just used our old vacuum to clean the carpet in our living room that afternoon before the new dyson arrivedso guess what we did yep we pulled the dyson out of the box set it up and vacuumed the freshly cleaned carpet at least with our old vacuum and almost filled the canister with what was sucked up out of the carpet amazing using the dyson is extremely intuitive and easy it navigates well around and under furniture and emptying the canister is simple and straightforward the level of cleaning it produces is outstanding the unit is very light compared to our other vacuums and is easy to storeone of the features that i find a delight is the fact that this vacuum is the only one we have ever had where the cord stowed properly once wound around the storage posts all of our other vacuums would have the plug end of the cord terminate at either the upper or lower storage post never in the middle you would wrap and wrap the cord around to stow it then once you came to the end of the cord it would be right at upper post with nowhere to clip it because you cant use the cord clip at the bend around the posti know this may seem trivial but to me it shows the level of thought that went into designing the dysonwe also purchased quite a few accessories and using them is a breeze i really like how the hose will pop right out of the handle for quick touchup worknice design superpowerful cleaning performance light and easy to use i am really pleased we finally made the decision to buy one of these outstanding vacuums
this coffee maker is the heavy duty and heavywow i spliced into my pex water line and used a watts easy snap and tee with a shut off valve works on copper too for a few bucks extra i drilled a hole in my countertop and ran the supplied water line this took me about minutes to do all this i am a handy personpros keep in mind that these pros are unique and because of them i would buy this system over and over again it fits snug against the wall leaving me with the much need counter top space this was beyond my expectations secondly about this is that it can stay there no more pulling out to fill with water or grounds stars it looks great yet blends in well this machine took about minutes off my coffee making from my old front access machine once it was installed i tested all the features the water comes out hot the cup sensor is nice but if in mid hot water fill you need to lift the cup and wait a few seconds for the upper water to drain it can beep when finished or not i prefer a thermal carafe because i do not like the taste of coffee that is reheated the carafe is sturdy easy to remove lid and is keeping my coffee hotwarm the attached water line is a brilliant feature this coffee maker appears very well built solid with good design of the simple featuresconanyone can program what you consider a cup it comes preset at which overflows a standard size ceramic coffee mug this is adjustable but only lets you go down to and up to if you have small mugs or tee cups this could be a problem this will also adjust the water flow of the options for the carafe i can assume this issue is not great enough to remove a full star from the review of a star the settings also removes star so i give it a star review kind of pickydear brew expressif this machine had a cup setting for filling a cor even a c and c vs the cup cup and cup and a cup setting that ranged it would be greatly improved
y nice finish mine has a light mount on the rear and extra hardware and hex key is a nice touch mounted on a rack friendly s hardtail trek mtb with rear tire in about ten minutes simple although accurately described the top platform is just about long and a little on a narrow side it looks undersized on my mtb in comparison my jandd expedition measures on the top platform and is wider a pretty big difference not necessarily a negative its light and hardly bulky and it does the job i guess if you were putting this on a sleeker road bike this size would be actually be a plus universal i think it will fit the majority of bikes that are rack friendly ie have mounting bosses and a fairly conventional chainstay distance i suspect the largest frames will have fit problems
i would rate this five stars but the seller listed them as new and then in their invoice stated they were not new but rather used by our had negligible signs of wear and they were loose not in plastic and had small thread fraying nothing that bothers me but not really what was described also they are insulated which means they will get heavier with water saturation again same issue as when in the service so ok with meactually crimps states they are used but amazon erroneously lists them with the offers upon further review clerical error and again they are in very good to excellent condition
the msr alpine bowl is made from durable stainless steel so it is scratch and dent resistant due to its stainless steel design it will not leach harmful chemicals or change flavors it has a capacity of oz is inches wide and weighs oz grams it is much less expensive than a titanium bowl with the tradeoff being additional weightif you are looking for a bowl to eat oatmeal cream of wheat cereal soup beans pasta small salad etc then the msr alpine bowl will work great and it is easy to clean you can place it over a fire to heat up the contents but use caution as the bowl will be hot and can cause a burn i use this bowl with themsr pocket rocket stoveand it works great your msr pots will be even more efficient if you allow them to blacken with use because a blackened surface absorbs heat better than a light oneif you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to titanium then the msr alpine bowl is a good choice that you will not regret
i bought this bag with the purpose for housing my nikon d since its an already padded bag but i wanted something outdoor tough and able to take a beating and get dirty since most camera bags as far as one should sling goes are black they get dirty easily especially if your trekking outdoors in the rain mud and what not which is why i went with this cause of the color khaki which is similar to coyote brown since im in the marine corp and take it with me to the field on occasion but also that its made of denier and teflon coated for water resistance i added my own extra padding since being a marine requires all technology to be definitely well padded if you value it but its a great bag plus its versatile cause you can switch it to the left or right shoulder and customize the sides of it with any other attachments
i had a joe blow floor pump for years i bought this one so i could give my old one to a neighbor who needed one this one seems to pump a bit easier not sure why however when used on schrader valves the lever is too tight and is difficult to get to latch completely the little pointer for setting a pressure slides too easily and can be moved inadvertently overcoming all that it does a great job and has a built in gauge that is easy to read and seems reliable the valve head fits both schrader and presta valves without any adapters it works great on the presta valves
first of all i bought a large for my inch waist and it fits just fine functionally no problem im carrying a fullsize ruger sr in a blackhawk kydex holster and no sag no rolling nada i just took an hour long walk to and from the grocery store and the gun was hardly noticeable this is a vast improvement from the other belts i have in the summer my sig causes no issues but now that winter is arriving i can carry my large gun wo problems btw im wearing patagonia pants and the belt fit through the loops just fine
i have owned this product for about two years and never had a problem at all i installed it on a m and blue locktited the screws never moved or come loose whatsoever the people that say they are not satisfied are crazy first its ncstarwhat quality do you expect second its third if it comes off your gun you are the incompetent and unsafe gunsmith from these reviews it looks like it only fits ms out of the box it will annoy anyone at the range because it spits out all that force to either side of you it can clear the lanes quickly i got it because i built a scout rifle for hunting and wanted the reduced recoil dont know if it is reduced or not i also used the rubber butt pad that is sold here and it is well worth it buy this product at your own risk and be sure you possess the competency level needed to work with guns safely

i use this for sighting in rifles from yards it works great it can just barely resolve cal holes at yards you need a sturdy tripod and perfect eye position on a bright day to do so cal holes are easier to see at yards colors look true at least with adequate light the eyepiece moves smoothly when adjusting magnificationthe included tripod is cheap plan on replacing it a thin nylon carrying bag is also included as well as lens caps the bag does not offer any protection so consider buying a card case if the scope will see rough use
i am always on the lookout for a good leak proof water bottle i can throw in my bag that will not leak i have been using a thermos bottle i found here on amazon that works well and then i saw this one and thought i would try it well this is my new favorite water bottle the top is sealed and secure and you have to push a button to open the mouthpiece to drink it is easy to drink from i found it much easier to drink from than your typical water bottle with the little spout since i started using this bottle instead of my old thermos brand bottle i am drinking much more water because it is so easy to use i also throw this in my bag and in the car and it rolls around and has not leaked yet i am ordering more of these
i have been drinking coffee every morning out of a melittastyle coffee filter for over a decade we have had a sized filter holder at home a sized filter holder for camping and for use on the boat we just bought a boat with a nice galley and propane stove and have been using the sized filter but we have to make coffee in a couple batches at a time i bought this filter because it held a filter and most importantly it collapses into a very thin form factor which makes it easy to stow in small spaces on the boatthe coffee made by dripping through a cone filter is the best we grind our own my favorite bean is verona from starbucks we grind finely a few notches bigger than the smallest setting on a cuisinart grindermmmmmm
ive been working out at health clubs and gyms for years recently i decided to get a treadmill and dumbell set and workout from home as those are the two pieces of equipment i use most im and am not looking to get huge just stay in shape i bought the bowflex selecttech and stand and couldnt be happier they are quality built and come with an excellent dvd outlining various lifts and the proper way to do them i thought i new it all but the dvd helps justify the cost of these dumbells in my mind outstanding product and great instructional dvd detailing proper technique to really get the most from you workout
when i first received this pedometer it took me a while to figure out how to use it however after reading the instruction manual i understood how to use the basic features i dont normally use a pedometer and if i do it is usually a cheap one so i can not comment on how easy it is to use compared to higherend pedometers if you runwalk everyday it does have a cool feature where you can estimate how many calories you burned and how far you went during your workout it also does have a simple pedometer function to count your stepsone thing that i loved about it was that i could stick it in my purse and at the end of the day i could see how far i walked without having a big bulge on the waist of my shorts i love the color because when i stick it in my bag it is very easy to find it has a removable clip on the back and a wrist strap that has a clip attatched to the end of it
we are regular picnic goers and have always felt the need to stay away from the sun infact i was looking for a perfect picnic umbrella and i ran across the sportbrella x large umbrella this was exactly what i wanted about four to five of us can comfortably sit or lay down under the umbrella it not just protects my family from sun burns but also from the ghastly sand breeze since i bought the sport brella our picnics have become a pleasureno matter what the weather is we enjoy our outing the foot wide range is hard to find in the market and i was lucky to get it on amazon and that too for this price
did my review on this item like i always do before i purchase anything was looking for something basic and easy had bought my first ar and needed some front and rear sights for it wanted to buy something for a good price that performs like its ten times better then what it cost definitely would recommend to those looking for basic front and rear flip up sights but if you are looking for good quality and something more sleek i would definitely go with the magpuls only cons about this was its bulky size when flipped up it goes over my scope gon na have to find a way to work with it also when trying to flip up and down its too hard i dont know if its just mine or what but its so hard to flip them up and down going to try and put some wd or something on those but again if your looking for something basic and nothing fancy i would go with these i am probably going to upgrade soon
most a star value price compared to construction easily gives it a star rating if the knob was metal and not plastic id give it stars of course it can be pried into but it serves the purpose of fitting inside large vehicle consoles being mounted to the vehicle itself with the cable or holes and will fit a compact pistol and mag depends on pistol dimensions or other valuables are you carrying your answer can honestly be no when its quickly unloaded and placed inside this locked case that cant easily be opened combo lock insures force is needed to open not a key taken from you also great for placement around the home or shop for locked and loaded storage as is your right and is usually allowed by law because its on your property
i cant believe i had this thing for two years already i use this every other day and it is still working perfectly every other day i pump tires up to psi with ease im usually in a bit of a hurry so im a little rough with it sometimes but it still shows no signs of wearing out or breakingthe gauge is very easy to read and comes with a little easytosee red indicator to help the tube is a decent length so you dont have to be right on top of your tire to pump it up it can do presta of schrader valves and also comes with a needle for sports balls football basketball etci went through a few supercheap department store brand pumps before i decided to purchase a good one the cheap ones always seem to break easily or not be able to handle high psi this pump does it all with ease and is definitely worth the money
the item arrived packaged in a cardboard box with little padding there was a small dent on the bottom but i am going to put many more dents in it before i am done the worst part of the design is that the lower handlering is attached to the body by two rivets that extend into the container these rivets are postioned inches from the pottom of the pot as soon as i got this pot in the mail i filled it with water and put it on a napkin sure enough the left rivet leaks at the rate of about drop per second or so the handlering connection that the rivet secures is oriented such that it provides maximum stress on the rivets each time the handle is and therefore puts maximum stress on the rivets which implies that even if the rivets were to be pounded to fit more snugly in the holes they would eventually be loosened by using the handle a simple band around the outside of the body would have provided a better connectionpoint for the handlering and the body of the pot could keeps its integrity alternatively i would have much preferred the handlering connection to be spot welded in place no rivets or to not be there at all drilling holes into a pot for rivets does not make sense expecially only a third of the way from the bottom if you do use rivets at least make sure they work these rivets donti did not test the waterintegrity of the rivets holding the bailing handle they are located only inches from the brim and i do not envision filling it up that far the bailing handle was pretty nice in that it was designed to hold the handle securely in standard positions of and just above horizontal on either sidethe pot is the right size inches tall to the edge of the brim inches in diameter at the bottom with littleno taper going upit weighs in at pounds without the percolation stuff insideit is pounds with the percolation stuff insidethe little clear knob on top is clear plasticthe price was right so i may experiment with trying to modify the design of the pot to eliminate the lower rivet holesyou get what you pay for in this case the price only covers a potentially nice pot that is ruined by stupid engineering
i bought this revolver as a marksmanship training device this resembles the colt python or diamondback revolver except for being single action you must cock the hammer for each shot it takes three times the training time and twice the ammuntion to achieve proficiency with the doubleaction revolver as it does with the semiautomatic handgun and revolver shooters require more refresher training ive only owned and fired two colt doubleaction revolversthe rest have been smith and wessons or clones of smith and wesson so the cylinder rotates and i can not get the feel of the doubleaction trigger there is also the durability issuethis revolver is too flimsy for dynamic tactical traininghowever as a safer alternative training device to a live revolver for handling and basic marksmanship this works well it feels good in the hand if about a quarter the weight of the real revolver trigger pull is short and lightnot up to the colt standards but adequate for training id place the target no more than ten feet from the shooter and five feet isnt too close wear your safety goggles not included firing signature is low for shooting at moving targets the low velocity brightlycolored mm pellet acts like a tracer bullet in good light being able to fire indoors without a special range and being able to reuse ammunition keeps practice costs low as you master sight alignment and trigger control the seperate cartriges are nice for training in revolver handling and loadingunloading exercises the cartridges are easy to load but rough handling will cause the mm pellets to fall out i ordered an additional package of cartridges so that i could practice reloading the pistol lacks durability for dynamic drills but for a beginner who practices smoothly performing every action perfectly it works very welli commend the adjustable sightsthey work like the originalsbut be careful to gently adjust the sightsi was looking for an inexpensive training revolver that i didnt need a formal firearms range for safe practice i can not fire combat drills with this revolver but i do have a device that permits me to safely shoot indoors at feet and practice sight alignment and trigger control i have to load without using a speed loader cant find one that fits but that works for the beginner too
first off this machete isnt anything fabulous it comes rough you will need to clean the burs of the blade its just a ground piece of steel on the other hand its a machete so a razor edge is about as useful as on that as porch on a space station this guy goes through foliage and vines like nobodies business machetes have regional styles and this style does not do that great against ohio hardwoods its good for saplings and vines but to get through a tree you better have a good amount of time on your hands if you are taking down brush it is a good investment if you are chopping trees get a one with more weight or an ax or hatchet if you collect machetes as i do its cheap so why not add it to your collection
there seems to be some truth to the belief that lefthanded persons are more accident prone than the majority at least in my case i have always kept reading materials available like grays anatomy and its cousins in the medical field it was with some chagrin a while back that i took stock of my resources for medical attention and found bandaids tripleointment and a few other items hoary with age doing a little research led me to adventure medical kits the hunter kit it had a good selection of routine remedies for outdoor activities and aroundthehome mishaps and invited expansion the most important items i added were several quikclot packets polar pure water disinfectant and potassium iodide tablets since i live within twenty miles of two nuclear power stations the hunter kit listed its intended longetivity as days for people it is a compact waterresistant bag stuffed to the max and fits into my eastpack with plenty of room to spare for other essential components in all my medical resources have multiplied at a relativly moderate cost included with other ezy instructions is the excellant comprehensive guide to wilderness and travel by dr eric a weiss with an overall view of emergency medicine outside urban care a must item for outdoor enthusiests and homebodies alike my only eyeopener was that many of the antibiotic ointments sterile gauze etc were made in china now china can make highquality products but id like some assurance when it relates to healthfield products so the adventure kit hunter kit looked nicely equipped and ezy to use ill test it out
the holster works fine for my px compact even with a laser attached my laser mounts under the barrel with a flashlight under the laser the pistol fits in the holster fine with only the laser not with the light mounted i dont use it for a quick draw but good to have if needed while around the camp sight i can easilly draw the pistol and snap the flashlight on if i had to i may have a seamstress customize the holster by splitting the seam and maybe add a heavy duty velcro elastic strap so it could fit to whatever use i need id give it a star rating if it had initially fit my use with all accessories attached
fter opening the packaging and reading the instructions on the back of the card i grabbed my dullest kitchen knives and pulled one through the slot both knives were exactly identical in every way so i left one unsharpened to see how sharp the other knife got in comparison and since im a leftie i automatically held the handle of the knife sharpener in my right hand and pulled the knife through the slot with my left thus doing against the arrows i didnt realize this at first and continued to sharpen the knife it got sharp anyway i though i had ruined the knife sharpener by pulling the knife through it the wrong way but apparently not i have since learned to hold the sharpener and use it as a righthanded person should it still seems to sharpen most of my kitchen knifes nicelyi ran about different knives of varying sizes and dullness through it and after experimenting with the degree of angle knob i got them pretty sharp im not a knife sharpening expert by any means but i like sharp kitchen knives as much as the next person i had a really dull bread knife that got sharp and i am anxious to try it out on a fresh baked loaf i ran a few pairs of cheap scissors through it and got some sharpness but nothing to really write home aboutthis sharpener works well enough but dont expect to get razorsharp edges i still have a super dull old pocketknife to run through it and see how it does also one of my newer paring knives got pits in the edge of the blade where there were none before sharpening i dont know if the sharpener caused them or just allowed weak areas in the steel to get knocked out while sharpening i did not press hard on the blades while running them through the various slots i also sharpened a couple of serrated knives and they sharpened nicelyi like that its a manual tool too and therefore does not require batteries or a power supply other than human energy
i believe the marketing on this pushes as a bag for swim gear but i use it for my mma gear at the gym for me it easily fits a pair of boxing gloves mma gloves and shin pads in the main compartment the seperate zippered pocket is handy for small accessories in my case hand wraps and a wrap winderthe water bottle holder fits a standard gatorade bottle like you see on nhl and nba benches perfectly it leaves just a little slack which is easily taken in by the drawstring on the bag the drawstraing will also help you fit a smaller water bottlei would recommend this bag for anyone who has gear they need to air without emptying their bag
this is the best cleaning rod you will ever buy it is expensive for a cleaning rod however after having bunch of mix and match of several brands this is the one that i always pick for cleaning it is longer than your standard cleaning rods that you see at sporting goods store but it will clean almost all long barrel riflesupdate th feb unfortunately the cleaning rod broke from the brass tip in less than a year i called the battenfield technologies owners of tipton brand and they agreed to send me a replacement for free of charge i will see how long the replacement will last so stars for customer service and minus stars for product
butt pad looks like itll do the job though i decided to simply order a new stock for my mosin instead of using this on the year old piece of driftwoodi thought perhaps i could still use the stripper clips but they are built incorrectly it seems they used a gauge of steel which is slightly too thick i cant get the clip fully seated into my rifle to even attempt to load the rounds if i did force the clip in place it would put enough inward force on the rounds that they wouldnt slide out anywayturned out to be a worthless purchase for me will have to see about returning them
i have a box full of various holsters that i have picked up over the years and not one of them would fit this frame the slot is wide and the smallest clip i could find was the slot will need to be drilled out to widen it paddle holsters will not work on this bracket at all all of the websites i visited selling this bracket indicated that a ps or ps were both made to fit this bracket when i searched each site for the either of these holsters i got a message i tried googling for either but none of the hits i got offered either the ps or ps holsters when i have time i will drill some holes in the bracket to widen the slot so be advised that you will probably have to do the same i dont remember ever seeing a clipon holster with such a narrow clip it would be nice if they just offered these two holsters as an add on sale it would save a lot of hassle
for swim workouts speedo jammers are the way to go especially if you dont have the body of an olympic swimmer they are comfortable and look way better than the bikini brief or square cut speedos both of which i have also it may be a placebo effect but i actually felt that my performance increased in these shorts the fabric of the sonic splice is nicer than that of the rapid splice so pay the extra and get these i bought them both and sent back the rapid spice because the quality isnt as good i bought a size and the fit is perfect im and pounds and wear most things in a size but i wouldnt want this swimsuit any bigger so im glad i went with the smaller size they come down about short of my knees they also have a very long drawstring on the inside my buddy who swore hed never wear a speedo bought a pair of these for training and loves them ive only been using them once a week for a couple months so i cant attest to their longterm durability but so far they still look like new
i purchased this berkley stainless steel hook remover to use for fish with big deep toothy mouths and found it to be a solid gripping hook remover it can grip as tightly as you can squeeze and set solid on the hook for some of the easiest removal of hooks you might expect i first looked at this picture of the hook remover from berkley like it might be flimsy and not worth the purchase but after receiving it and considering its price of with prime free delivery it really is a bargain i love it and recommend it for my friends
in general i much prefer the wide mouth nalgene to any other bottle i do have one narrowmouth nalgene but it is less userfriendly than the wide mouth however as you all know by now it can be a pain to drink from a widemouth bottle this is especially true for those of you who put ice in your bottlehonestly i didnt think much of this lid when i first saw it it looks a bit odd and it almost seemed a bit gimmicky to me that changed once i put it in use i like that it has more of a soft rubber feel than plastic helps avoid hurting skin on wet andor cold hands and now that i am used to the design i really appreciate the design i still have the widemouth so its easy to add mixes ice or anything else to the bottle but im able to drink from it without spilling down my shirt and im still able to pop it in the dishwasher
i have only used this pot for two trips so far but it has been a great asset i dont actually use the percolator since my sister and i drink coffee and our children drink hot chocolate so we just heat the water and then make our drinks the last water carafe i owned we had to fill twice but this one has enough capacity for adults and children to have a plentiful round of drinks in the morning the inside of the pot gets watermarks very easily but that does the bother me as long as there is no rust the only thing that i am cautious about is that it seems like it could be bent fairly easily as it is a pretty thin container overall it is a great buy and a very useful tool
these are well made and easy to adjust but be aware that they are considerably than your average brake pads you can easily lock up the front wheel at slow speeds and that can lead to disaster i admit it happened to me and i am an experienced and careful riderthey are really good pads but do watch out for thatif you are willing to adjust a bit lay off the front brake at slow speeds or be gentle and never pull the front brake in a slow speed emergency yes that can happen then they are finei might use these on the rear and my old black kool stops on the front they did not grabother reviewers have mentioned this so i was aware but that didnt help me from making a split second error my old kool stops black pad wouldnt have tossed me

please let me be clear i only have miles on them but i purchased the c x x to replace my michelin city x mm tires thinking i could have better tread on trails and dirt roads for that yes they are substantially bettermy problem lies in the fact that i wanted a good centerline tread because of my commute is on regular paved roads the issue with these tires is the irregular centerline allows the gap on either side to grab on things like the white line on the road and literally slip over left or right while you are riding this happens on cracks too as well as filled potholes basically they shift out from underneath you slightly whenever one of those irregular points rub up against somethingi am hoping that another few miles will wear these down a bit so that this doesnt remain a problem so i will stick it out for a bit but at this time i do not plan on buying them again at ea you get what you pay fora regular tire with normal centerline does not really have this problem but because these tires have the zigzag shape they are very unstable on the road in fact i have some continental towne country tires x that roll better and are faster even though they are wider heavier and slower i also have some continental gatorskins c x mm that do not exhibit this problem and some continental ultra mm that are also fine but they do not have tread
the wind does blow this over pretty easy so youll have to use the yard stakes with it but the height and width are perfect to catch the balls the bag that came with it is not going to hold up many times its already stretching at the seams so plan on getting some bungy cords for the long haul the net is light enough though to take back and forth from the field to the car and easy enough for kids to set up i have the smaller net x and its good for little ones up to middle school but for older kids or adults youll need the x size i would not recommend leaving it setup outside it doesnt appear to be that heavy duty so the wind and rain would quickly destroy it but for the price and overall convenience i would highly recommend great if youre a coach and want to get the kids hitting without having to chance down all those stray balls
purchased this spoke wrench after my disappointment for park tools mini spoke wrench sw avenir has designed a much better productboth sides are marked with the corresponding numbers so you dont have to turn it over to determine if you have the correct size also this spoke wrench is substantial as far as the thickness and is not a flimsey toolunlike the park tools sw which has only slots for sizes the avenir has this tool really works as i used it to remove a broken spoke while professional bike mechanics may prefer the individual spoke wrenches this tool is great for the hobbyist
why did i play around with pump action bb guns in the past co is the way to goi like to plink around in the shop after work keep the skill set high for the real firearms umarex has done a really good job with this platform the round burst is awesome you can customize that with a good trigger pull to rd burst if you want easy to load straight shooter from the start i installed a front grip and a redgreed dot open sightit sounds great and shoots hard and fast its fun that you have to pull back the charging handle other guns i have had didnt have that feature i really have no cons on this thing
this scope was purchased to use on a romanian wasr on a promag high rise side rail mount i had previously purchased one scope an sks the scope has its limitations but the benefits outweigh the cons it is a xmm but keep in mind that despite it not having a focus which other nc star scopes may have it does provide a clear sight picture at a distance and at night on a clear moon lit night or with the aid of a flash light those who dont understand this concept it look down upon it but as the objective lense is seen at a distance the image is clear and i have not issues with clarity at all even while wearing glassesfor more you can get a x mm compact scope with additional features and for more money illumination for an additional fee but why make the expense if not all neededthis kit does not include a set of rings but you must get the inch rings or the mm rings with the inch inserts definitely use blue lock tite on the screws of the rings for added securityoverall i would highly recommend this scope to anyone looking for an inexpensive alternative to use on any sporter type ar or ak variant for cqb or short to medium range shootingit has the coin adjustment screws for the recticle but as most inexpensive scope its not bad at all and easy to make adjustments especially with using a laser boresighterthe instructions on how to use the p recticle are included in the package which is very straight forward in usei have used nc star products on various weapons and have not had any issues with their scopes and other productsthe shipment arrived rather quickly which is a good thing
i wasnt planning on adding a light or bipod to my i was really just after a good solid sidesling mount however i figured that i may as well get this product anyway since even though i had no plans for the rails at the moment it might be nice to have options later several reviewers commented that some fitting may be necessary for the rail to clear the side of the stock i had a choice either trim metal from the back of the rail to clear the stock or trim some wood from the stock to clear the back of the rail well for me wood cuts easier than metal a couple fast passes with a saw blade and enough wood was removed i have a few extra wood stocks around from switching out guns to butler creek folders so i didnt mind cutting up a factory wood stock if you prefer not to be ready with a dremel and some grindingcutting bits to take off enough metal to clear the stock other than that little hiccup the product works as advertised far more solid than a comparable product made of plastic be nice if they sold a slingbar to mount to the side of the rear of the stock as well some folks were complaining about the priceyeah it isnt but to get a solidly made product even with that one flaw im willing to shell out thirty bucks only need to buy it once anyway right as long as you go into it with your eyes open and realize you may have to do a little diy on getting a proper fit id say buy this product and youll be pleased
i actually bought this set for the small single pieces to mount on my helmet so i could mount a flashlight or camera or whatever i wanted when the bag of rails arrived i decided i would try to mount the long rails on my magpul moe carbine length foregrip lo and behold it fit my only beef which is just me being greedy is i wish it came with more fasteners so i could mount the other rails to other things otherwise this is an awesome set of rails that comes with tools and all if i need more i would definitely buy another bag
while recognizing that the imperative of a real emergency is likely to overcome ones resistance to the tedium of cranking this lantern it should be noted that minutes of cranking vigorously only produces enough power for minutes of lighting or twenty minutes of radio usage and possibly some numbness in your fingertips further five minutes of cranking produced no measurable change in the charge state of my blackberry charge condition was however verified on its display the light produced by the lantern is quite bright and a milky white but as touted on an attached sticker may be a bit of an overreach under emergency conditions where one may be comforted by anything this is certainly adequate between marathon cranking sessions for a game of cards or a picnic or rummaging in a closet i wish the build were a bit better the plastic construction is more toy than tool and the switches all feel like lowest bidder hardware the radio sound quality and volume is adequate but since i am not in the us currently i can not attest to its sensitivity the tuning dial is illuminated which is handy i would note that the radio seems quite power hungry it really saps the generated charge quicklyi will keep this in my go bag for earthquakes and other natural disasters but it will be supplemented by other emergency equipment
ike several other reviewers i ordered this without realizing that its designed for someone in the pound weight range i should have ordered the threepound hoop and im not downgrading my review for how heavy it is what i am downgrading it for is that this is still heavy and it hurts when you whack yourself with it or when it falls to the floor and hits an ankle or part of your foot my husband and i both played around with this when it arrived this afternoon and it even hurt him and hes in the expected weight range for itwe also had some troubles putting it together when i tried to put it together myself i couldnt get the pieces to stay in even though they seemed secure my husband used it and it feel apart and went flying funny yes but it could have done some damage when my husband fixed it the pieces all snapped easily into place except for one the hole that the piece fit into wouldnt align with another piece so my husband had to use a pair of household scissors to shave a bit of plastic off of one of the holes to make the piece fit if you find that they dont fit you might have to do thisalso i wish that this had come with an instructional video of some sort it came with a poster that had a few suggestions for how to use this hoop but a short practice video of the kind that comes with other altus products ive purchased before would have been niceoverall this is a nicely made hoop once you get it put together properly and im giving it stars
ive owned a million garmin products i got this unit to replace my garmin as i thought it would be a good update i didnt need the maps and always like the and thought this would be an awesome update truth is it is and isnt what i love is the ability for the unit to connect to a smart phone it was awesome to have it upload my workout right after finishing live tracking is neat but no one i knew cared to watch me ride live let alone view my post ride datagiven its size and price i think a better option is the if you want a smaller unit save some money and buy the old
it has been a few months since getting bow and writing first review below the bow is great my daughter still loves it and is very good with it we did switch to carbon arrows from the local pro shop and it helped tremendously with the speed and accurancy would like to know how to make the weight heavier since it gives a range but dont recall instructions with the bowjust got bow my daughter and i shot around arrows it is fun and easy for beginners we are already pulling it back as far as it can go so probably should have bought one with more draw was extremely disappointed to pay oo plus shipping for it and before it was even delivered it is now cheaper and has free shipping
i use gloves and a heavy bag as part of my aerobic workout so i cant give firsthand feedback on these when used in the ring but for my workouts they have been excellent performersthe construction quality is solid better than i expected given the price all the stitching is heavyduty and nicely made the gloves i have the ounce are heavier than my old pair but the weight feels good the padding is excellent another critical point for me excellent hand protection without any sacrifice in comfort these look and feel like they should cost a lot more than the price point they are hitting pun sort of intendedalthough the logos and overall graphic design are a bit much the construction quality protection and comfort easily earn these five stars highly recommend
i have owned this exact knife for quite some time and ive been quite happy with it after years of abuse the little plastic nub on the back what you pull down on to open the knife in its assisted function broke off leaving a small pokey metal nub that is not fun to apply the necessary force to so i came here to buy a replacementi was really happy with it until i pulled down on the new knifes nub and nothing happened it just needs to break i thought and i made doublesure i had the safety off and so forth the knife opens and closes as it should but the assisted open nub does nothing why its been deliberately disabled theres supposed to be a bentover catch that pushes out on the blade when you pull down on the nub the new knife has that catch cut off entirely this means that nub on the back of the knife is completely nonfunctional it moves back and forth and does nothing serves no purposeive submitted a replacement request through amazon but well see whether the new knife is a properly functional one or a similarly castrated modelcalling what they sent me an opening is blatantly false advertisingnot pleased not at alledit the replacement knife arrived and it was a proper autoassistedopenerits an awesome knife once you you get the right one
i highly recommend this if you tow tubes and the like this is what you need it keeps the towed item tension centered and appears to be well made it keeps the boat from having that pull left or right making it a distraction while towing from transom eyes i have a ski eye but those are never made to take the pull from a tube which is far greater the a skier or wakeboard the pulley itself is made of light weight metal material with a plastic wheel but i dont have any issues with it so far you do have to watch the initial pull until it has tension otherwise it could get tangled on itself it does try to floatthe only drawbacks to it are what it is intended to reduce and that is the pull from side or the other it takes some sharp turns back and forth if you want to kick someone out of the wake while towing them it works a little too well but just takes some practice and a brave soul on the tub
im pretty happy with these pedals they feel solid and are weighted so that the clip side flips up which is how i use them most often i have to agree with others who have said that the platform side is a bit slick its fine if youre in the saddle and cruising along but i definitely dont feel very secure if i need to stand up to power up a hill unless im clipped in the platform side is too slippery and doesnt grip any kind of shoe i may actually try to rough it up a bit with a file
i have been collecting knives since i was a kid and firmly believe that dollar for dollar there is nothing out there like a mora knife they come very sharp from the factory and with very little effort can be made unbelievably sharp this knife is no exception it is now scary sharp and i know from experience that it will hold that edge unbelievably well and if i do dull it a few swipes on my ceramic sticks will bring that scary edge right back i love the handle on this knife it is very comfortable and is easy to hold on to the sheath is good looking and functional the drain hole in the bottom is a clever idea as well get this knife you cant go wrong at this price
i bought this dvd at target when i was looking for a new workout the positive thing about this workout is the enthusiasm of the instructor this workout comes in three sections first one is minutes second one is minutes and the third is minutes you are supposed to do the first one for a couple of days the second workout for weeks and then to the last workout for the remaining weeks if you are at an intermediate or advanced level you will find the minute workout waaaay too easy i find myself doing only the minute routine because it makes the most sense the third routine is extremely boring and repetitive ms seibers is terrible at cueing which means that she jumps into the next set of exercises with little to no warning this is most evident in the third routinea plus to these workouts is that you have the option of doing it with or without the music the downside to this is that the workout was obviously filmed without music so if you choose to use it with the provided music the routines are not in sync with the beat this is very annoyingthat all being said i feel that you can get into shape if you follow this workout
this fits like it was ment for my motorized bike it can hold liters of pop on either side and a gallion of milk it will hold plastic grocery bags total this has been a godsend for me so i can finally go to the grocery store when i cant get anyone to take me i run out of mt dew every days and people get tired of driving me there so this really helpd and you can get the strap down doggie seat and it fits just fine i just wish they made a strap on bigger basket to put on top of this so i could haul more groceries
while this may not be a decorative bowie that you would wear while riding or even the first choice in a personal defense bowie it is definitely a do it all blade camping hiking survival prep these are the functions best suited to this blade dont let that full you though it could easily be used in a defensive situation all though it was not intended for that task the lack of a guard upon the top is good for choking up for more delicate tasks while still giving you the leverage to wield it through a mountain trek and clear a path if you are looking for a solid bowie but not interested in or have enough money for a more shiny and showcase style bowie this is for you
i bought this knife a while back and have used it for a few years now it is one of my blades that tasted my flesh i cut myself opening a back of gatorade this knife has done some carving fishing gutting food prepping etc it is a neat little folder i use at home and outdoors the only recommendation id make would be to have the sheath velcro be replaced with a button then i would feel better about carrying the knife on my belt just saying if gerber is listening this blade design just works never slips when wet and i love how it just feels in my hands
if you transport your bike with a trunk rack or hitch this piece is very handy also if you have a smaller bike or typically full suspension bike it makes it so much easier to put on and off the rack with adding protection to your bike if your cables go underneath the top tub where the bike hits the rack then it protects your bikes cables this piece also lowers your bike keeping it out of the wind which is great for gas mileage and keeping it out of the wind this particular lobster claw is nice because it has two claws that open up and hook onto your bike the ends are a sturdy material with some kind of rubber around it to protect from scratching your bikeprosease of useload bikes easyconsnot always necessary
the shock cord on the front needed to be replaced right out of the packaging i replaced it with paracord that being said the only other problem i had is my lightweight sleeping bag would barely fit the sleeping bag pocket my sleeping bag is a little smaller than a basket ball when compressed i did find a zipper hidden in the sleeping bag pocket though and it allowed me to put my sleeping bag in a little easier it needs more pockets to keep things tidy it also need another inch of mesh added to each mesh pocket along with a drawstring im going to make some modifications to this bag before i inevitably get rid of it for a cuscus ive heard some really good things about them lately and want to try them out
simple lightweight rock solid easy to zero holds zeroi bought this for a ddm v lw that came without iron sights i run this particular gun as a carbine with an aimpoint micro in the daniel defense mount and when using an aimpoint i prefer a solid front and rear buis like this used in conjunction with daniel defenses excellent fixed front sightdaniel defense fixed fr sight rail mountdutilizing a lower cowitness i see a lot of people with flip up buis and personally i only prefer the flip up buis if running with a magnified optic the fixed irons do not get in the way of an aimpoint in my opinion and i trust them as being more solid plus it is faster to transition to irons if you dont have to flip them upthis rear and dds front rear i linked to would also make an excellent primary iron sight for those who do not want to run an optic
ive been waiting a little more than a month to put the review in so at least i got more experiences on the watch just like other gshocks this one is sturdy could be a little big if you have small wrist and used to those dressy watches the white color and the size will caused some extra attentions to your wrist mostly nice complements when i first bought it i reset the time accordingly with my iphone its now more than a month and the watch has gone faster about sec compared to my phone so it could be better but i wouldnt complained about it it could be hard to tell the time in the dark the light is not cover the whole face of the watch plus the very busy face design make it harder to look at the hands the watch and its band is in shiny white and easy to clean wipe off if you get it dirty and as always amazon customer service is second to none in case you have any questionproblem with your purchase a very happy purchase for me update check with the iphone again today and the watch shows about a minute and sec faster so unless you are a kind of perfecttimer person otherwise you can reset the watch once say every or months just to make sure it wont go out way off the time line everything else are great got it dirty a couple of time some water and soap would take it right off still a happy camper
i have been using packtowls for over years and this nano stylesize is a nice addition to the line i like the fact that i can keep it in its small carry pouch clipped to my softsided tackle bag so its always handy when fishing i open it up and clip it to one of my belt loops so its always easily accessible the thinner material doesnt hold the water like the thicker original style does so it dries even faster which allows me to keep it clipped to a belt loop without getting my pants wet where it comes into contact with my pant leg

i am writing this review with the belief that this built to be carried to softball and baseball practices and not to be set up long term set up for the first time took less than five minutes and is intuitive and straight forward the pieces are clearly marked and the whole thing is quite stable when set up it is sharp looking and every function seems to work as advertised the quality and build seems like this will last for a long time including the nets as long as they are brought in out of the weather the set is very nice for the price it comes with a nice duffle bag to store and carry the system inthe only thing is i would make sure an adult or two is setting this up instead of allowing kids to do it the tension on the rods is quite high when you are putting it together and i could see someone slipping and getting injured
ounce stainless steel water bottle is just right for the times when a water bottle are necessary or wanted it sits perfectly in a cup holder and holds just the right amount of clean fresh water with little chance of ingesting that bad plastic stuff known as bpa the wide mouth is just the right size for inserting ice cubes not too big though and screwing the plastic cap on included in the package is a belt clip and holder cant say too much for either of them however it seems as if you placed too much pulling pressure on either a problem would exist i however did not try to break either for the price and purpose this is just right for everyday use and if it gets damaged too much just chunk it and get another shucks for the price it is well worth every cent if the clip were an issue they are readily available at any sports shop or big box type store off the cuff wonder how these would do for a martini holder
d many reviews about fingers getting pinched and care being needed but went ahead and ordered anyway since it was half the price of most brands and i needed of themdont understand what all the fuss was about since i have no problems with pinching whatsoever and it is easily installedmy only concern is the front stem metal pin may cause a lot of scratching and marring of the soft aluminum stem i think i solved this easily by cutting a piece of robber hose with a inch inner diameter to slip over the pin between the ushaped bar thus eliminatingany metal to aluminum contact i havent used it yet but looks like it should workwith that being said i would recommend it to anyone who wants to save some money
i was looking for a bag to hold some equipment and supplies for fieldwork and this bag seemed like a good fit if it were made of higher quality materials it definitely would have been a good bagwhen the bag arrived it seemed to smell slightly of some kind of petroleum product it reminded me of fuel oil but it wasnt quite right anyway it aired out quickly enough so this didnt really bother mewhat did bother me is that within a week of very moderate use the inner liner of the bag in the front compartment tore along the seam exposing the foam padding within the liner the bag wasnt used roughly and was never stuffed to the brimim pretty disappointed because the bags design is pretty much perfect for what i need
this gun is fun to shoot they need to make a speedloader for this gun i havnt found one yet the last a long time if your not just slaming the triger it will shoot as fast as you can pull the triger it has a looong triger pull but most bb cos do it has a sweet spot because the triger dosnt need to be let out fully to set the next bb and air charge so if your good you can fire very fast i havent made it jam yet its accurate farther than i thought great gun for plinking toomain purpose in my opinion i was shooting over feeta little far for this rifle i hit somethning the size of softball out of times at that rangehey the others were close lol i needed to move in feet to see what the gun and have not done so yet but im sure it gets even better at the foot range
ill get the reservation out of the way first there is no sternum strap a real bummer but the easy fix is a short bungie cord with a bit of persistence high sierra will send you an add on strap call em as the other reviews have pointed out the features ill not go into that much other than to totally endorse the hidden storage net pull it out of the pack bottom attach to the loops near the top and fill it with whatever misc stuff you desire i also particularly like the large exposed fill cap designi recently completed a hour walk with this pack found it to be very comfortable on my back and shoulders avoid any high sierra pack with no waist belt why they even make a back pack with no waist beltor sternum strapis beyond me
i bought this lantern for a cave exploring trip to peru unfortunately while on the bus to the cave all my gear was stolen except a small back pack in which i had the wind n go mini led lantern i still went into the cave which was a big mistake first of all this thing doesnt produce enough light to see feet in front of you then it broke on me so i was stuck a mile inside a cave in the darkness luckily i had a pack of matches so i lit my clothes on fire and got out after hours by using flamable bat grease on a stick to make a torch i also had the misfortune of crawling on bat guano and maggotsstick with batteries and electric eels
this is a great product because all you need is a supply of sticks or twigs to keep it going i use pruning shears to cut my wood to length i dont need a axe by the way cutting an ample supply of sticks to length before hand is a good idea the solo stove is light weight it can use a small alcohol stove but i dont have experience with that so i cant really speak to it but as far as wood all you have to do is collect a few fallen branches and some kind of tinder and you can get a fire going quickly the stove will boil water in around ten minutes at least at our altitude it is also going to go in to my food storage plan in case of emergency i will still be able to produce a meal if your a prepper or camper or hiker you need to get one of these stoves leave the alchol bottles at home i have used this a few times now and i love it more each time
when i got this thing i could not wait to test it i grab my are as hard as i could and it did nothing that wouldnt make me rip my hand for my grip and punch myself in the face lol this might work on some average human but will do nothing against a ruffneck thug trying to rob you or some crazy trying to throw you on the train tracks another this is i dont why they dont make this in a clear plastic like the comtech stinger i mean its supost to be covert right i have yet to try it on another person as of yet but i will update as soon as i do
i had ordered this product and had some problems so i gave a negative review i have just deleted that review i contacted amazon about my problem and they contacted sneaky pete and the problem got resolved really quickly just a slight misunderstanding i can not speak highly enough about this product and the company selling it they are both of the highest quality if you own an lcp then this product is a must it wears well and functions perfectly it looks as if you are actually carrying a cell phone on your belt thank you sneaky pete for a great product and thank you for greater service
this product does everything well there isnt much question about that does it do everything the best no the sucks and displays virtually nothing other wrist worn monitors display much more probably at the expense of battery life yet afaik no other monitor is waterproof m and the ability to constantly wear without thought is a major plusthere are already tons of reviews on this so i will focus on two updating easywaterproof no need to take it offupdate november th i have actually lost pounds since i got this thing the band is ugly i prefer to take it off before pictures of any importance but of the time i leave it on and it sits visible like a reminder the simple fact that i look at the thing when i am considering what to order if eating out or deciding whether to go another blocks on a dog walk actually makes a difference everything recorded makes a difference visible makes a difference if the thing was so freaking ugly it would be a home run
first impression was its too big but after two years of using it i couldnt be happier this is my outdoor range bag so it had been through tough outdoor weather kick around in dirt and mud and it hold up well i dont think its water proof but in light rain it kept my gear dry it had just about enough pocket for my documents lunch water bottle medic kit tools and two full size pistols and it can hold more weight then i can carry apart from the mud that i am too lazy to clean off its practically in new condition after my abuse
i have had my wii fit for a few months now and find myself using it less and less sure the weather is nice so im getting outside more but truthfully i dont feel like im getting much of a workout from the wii fiti bought ea sports active without any reviews on amazon so i knew i was taking my chances however i am very pleased with it since i have a wii fit board i did use it for things like boxing and inline skating but it is not requiredfirst the thing i grumbled at the wii fit about every time i used itthere were no to do to keep me moving from one activity to the next sports active fixes that problem i chose to start the day challenge since i thought it would provide me a kick start the medium intensity workout was nice and left me pleasantly exhausted as i explored i was able to find a number of other prebuilt routines some especially focused on upper or lower body others on endurance and the ability to build your own custom routineother nice touches include being able to configure your workout music mix so that if youre not big into say electronica you wont find any of it playing in the background also the trainer is pretty precise and will point out if your bicep curls are not enough or your squat is too quick i also like that my onscreen self is more realistic and has actual hands instead of those round on the wii fit workouti see myself eventually needing a resistance band with more resistance which i know i can procure but for now it is good and while the nunchuckholding band around my thigh felt like it might not be secure or big enough it did fit with strap to spare and never moved during the workouti am very pleased to see how much more effective this program is than the standard wii fit and look forward to more games of this type
this shotgun bandolier is by far one of the best investments i have made it is made from very strong and durable materials and does in fact hold all rounds in the loops i read a review before i bought this product and some other reviewer said it didnt hold the full load it is ergonomically suitable for those who need an easier way of carrying shells on the a hunting trip or just needing a simpler way to hold rounds while out shooting trap or skeet a fully loaded bandolier isnt heavy on the shoulder or hard to get around even with having all the loops filled with buck shot slugs target shot game and so on with the shipping and handling the price came around to be almost which isnt that bad compared to getting one from a sporting goods store all around a good buy and you cant beat the price highly recommended
i bought one of these a few months ago and attached to my bike with no problems it is very lightweight and holds my oz water water well my daughter now runs in the side of me when i ride my bike and always takes sips out of my oz bottle which i need to my mile bike ride near our home i installed a nd of the same water bottle cage and bought a oz camelbak bottle for this new one which is attached now attached to the seat post that will be her bottle when she runs on my bike route it looks great and works as should im very happy with this ibera water bottle cage i give it stars
with two sons in the cub scouts ive had many years of camping with big old beat up sleeping bags that take up way too much space in the trunk when heading out to the campsite and are a pain in the rear when hauling luggage ive gotten quite a few laughs from my approach of spearing my walking stick through sleeping bags and having the boys carry it to our siteplus we usually take extra sleeping bags to open up and line the tent floor to help get off the ground and retain heatthat being said we need to start moving towards being more efficient slimmer mummy style backpacks are more streamlined and offer better heat retention in cooler weather less air the body has to heat up inside and with newer materials they compress quite nicely meaning they can easily be stuffed inside a backpack or lashed outside it which free up our hands for other taskslooking over the many options out there i settled on an inexpensive but well reviewed sleeping bag from ledge initially in grayyellow it came with its own compression sack and when it arrived both my boys tested it for comfortthe real test came a couple of weeks later when my older son took it on a scout campout and came back raving about iti went out and picked up a nd one for him so now each boy has their own the mummy bag is a bit long for them at ages but theyll have it for quite a few years eventually theyll get better down sleeping bags but right now this ledge synthetic bag works well and keeps them warm on the colder nights well see how it holds up in warmer weather or if it just ends up being a top coveringwith smaller compressed sleeping bags and sleeping pads also purchased our footprint is much smaller heading into camp
i just couldnt get this thing centered on the gamo regulation nra targets i was using if someone had paid me a zillion s to handle it it was simply impossible lo and behold i found the reason thoughthe two of the adjustment pots hex nutsscrews were faulty simply drilled into the metal at an odd angle vs being straight that caused adjustments to go haywire i could not remedy the problem so returned it for a refund i did like the weaver mount on this much better than the nc stars mount however i just couldnt make the red dot function worth a darn tho so back it wentedit i went ahead and gave this little gem another chance and the nd red dot laser has worked to perfection on my vigilante by crosmanbenjamin co bb and pellet air pistol once i found the adjustment pots were functioning correctly in the nd laser it was very simple to sight in using the factory sights even though the adjustments are with pots only it turns out that the two hex screws are more than adequate to get the job done in fact it was easier to sight this laser than a much more expensive laser that i have mounted on a rimfire caliber beretta pistolhaving the two adjustment pots with a pressure spring opposing them to hold the adjustment in place is very effective vs a fourpot adjustment system which most other laser red dots have as their mechanism i like it that hde went with something of their own design and not mainstream for this adjustment setup and came out a winner as it shows innovation and quality in this product even if it is only a sample it is true this isnt one of those elijicon sp things or even a much nicer in theory laser red dot by laserlyte aim sports any of the higher priced brands with measurable differences with this inexpensive red dot laser but fill its niche this one does just fine for the cheap end of laser sights my personal opinion after trying nc star utg and other laser red dots out and a couple green dots also is that the hde product is in a class by itself comparing just inexpensive red dots to it i find its well worth the price and then some buy this product knowing that you will get what you bargained for that is a red dot laser sight that works effectively and correctly in most applications and you dont have to break the bank to get one in your hands either wavey davey march
so if anyone actually used this for a bow it would work perfect however for those that are going to make a slingbow then know a few things the ring with the wiskers will fall out but is easy enough to fix i just applied a few beads of gorilla glue on mine and it works fine it also was easy enough to remove and replace remember this item isnt meant to be used for a slingbow its meant to go on a compound bow where there is something to hold that whisker in place the product itself is awesom
i was not looking to get a bench vise for gunsmithing purposes with the tipton best gun vise it is very easily assembled and i wanted a second set of hands for cleaning or maybe mounting sights the hardest part of using this tool for me has been to balance my open ar with the center support it was simply remedied by marking the appropriate mounting locations for each gunyou can get some flex in the plastic if you clamp the vise too tightly over the stock but its not a bench vise and i dont believe it was ever intended to be one i clean my guns each time after taking them out this vise really makes cleaning much easier and quicker i did purchase after reading the reviews with expectations that it is should perform like a hardcore bench vise i am satisfied that it is not that no dillusions about it it is a support and an extra set of hands and p erforms this task admirably i am very pleased with mine
the first problem i encountered with this boat was that it was way too easy to under and over inflate this thing i know it sounds crazy how could it be both right when we filled this in the shade we would fill it to capacity and load everything up once the sun warms up the tubes they will stretch and if you are using a strong trolling motor you will have to pull over to inflate it so we thought we might just fill it in the sun to not have that happen again because it got old real quick after trips out the problem we encountered that trip was that a inch blue gill was able to puncture the boat you read right people a inch bluegill crippled this boat on the main tube im not sure if we over inflated it or it was just weak due to being in the sun for hours on end the material loses it durable feeling after heating up it feels more like a pool toy if you cant catch bluegill without fear of popping the tubes its not worth anything at all my final complaint would have to be that if these things are so easily punctured they should come with a complete patching kit including the adhesive if you really cant afford anything better just know you are going to have to be extremely careful and could be out of bucks at any moment now i am out close to after registration fees for this do yourselves all a favor even if you are not fishing and go with the mariner intex hit the nail on the head with it although it cost more you are only going to get what you pay for it is much more durable and has an inflatable keel for improved steering you can also stand up due to the corrugated plaster floor insert in closing i do see this boat having a place for people on a budget but as ive said before if you can afford the mariner its a winner for sure
i purchased my utg tactical messenger bag for a recent trip to the uk i wanted something bigger and more versatile than my fanny pack but smaller and lighter than my backpack this little gem was the perfect compromise for meon the planei carried our tickets and passports in the easily accessible concealed carry pocket the main compartment carried my asus tf tablet and a book my cell phone went in a side pocket while snacks went in the front pocket under the flap a oz bottle of water fit perfectly in the bottle pocketfully loaded it was quite heavy but the wide adjustable strap and shoulder pad made for a comfortable carry through the airportsreconfigured for tourist mode i filled the main compartment with maps a camera and spare batteries this lighter load was an easy carry on our day trips lasting hours with hikes up to milesonly time will tell for sure but my bag appears to be very well made the material is thick and tough but flexible enough to allow a level of over stuffing the zippers also work well and didnt separate when id jam a compartment fullall in all i received an excellent bag that should travel with me for a long time
got this today and tried fitting on the sw mp the mount will not go all the way back and lock in place on a compact or subcompact the way to fix this is pretty simple but takes a little time i slid it on as far as it would go then marked approx how much metal would have to be removed from both sides of the rear of the mount got the old dremel out and started removing a little metal at a time until it would almost click in place i took some grit wet or dry sandpaper and finished removing the rest of the material on both sides checking it little by little until it clicked firmly into place i spent about minutes on it but it was worth it the light is just as bright as my other more expensive lumen ones i wanted a cheap alternative for using around the house and this seems to fit that after modifying it to fit i took it out in the backyard and it lights up all i need to see just fine for the price its not bad but just remember if you have a compact or subcompact this will not just snap on i put it on my colt defender and it snapped right in place works fine with no mods on full size semiautos i ordered another one today for the wifes mp
i bought this lock to use when im out riding and want to leave my bike outside the shop for a bit i have akryptonite new york noose chain bicycle lock with evolution series disc lock chain bicycle lock foot x inchwhich i use for work as in the bike is locked all day long away from where i can keep an eye on it and i wanted the best lock i could buy but that lock is heavy lbs this one is heavy but not that much in addition to this lock i also got akryptonite kryptoflex looped bicycle security cable mm x footto lock the front wheel to the bike so with a loop around the wheel and the pole and this lock around the pole my bike is pretty theft proof nothing is perfect thieves could still strip the parts but its a better lock than most other bike riders are using so it deters people enoughon this lock vs the noose the chain is more flexible in that you can lock the front wheel and the bike to the pole with the same level of high security the u part of the lock is smaller so its harder to pry it open you can get a new york version of the small lock and if you live in the worst area for bike theft id do that but at lbs that chain without a set of panniers to hold it is bulky and a pain to transporton this lock which size to get i like this medium size its big enough to go around the frame the rear tire and a parking meter the small one is just frametire size and the large one will also hold your front wheel if you take it off but its getting up there in weight like goldie locks medium is just right if you are unsure measure twice order onceon the mounting bracket it sucks which is why i gave this vs stars i wouldnt bother with the bracket instead bungie it to your rack or put it in your backpackmessenger bagon the key yes they are thin just be careful and dont force it and youll be fine
i camp for long periods of time in the alaskan bush this shower vastly improved our ability to enjoy our time there the liter size is enough water for one shower including washing your hair i cant really attest to its ability to heat up in the sun since the trip we took with it didnt have much sun but we heated water on the stove and added one tea kettle of hot water and that was enough to heat the shower water bag the thermometer on the bag is helpful and works well the water flow and pressure is pretty good considering it is a small nozzle i was surprised it flowed so well the only criticism i have is it is a bit difficult to completely fill the shower bag the cap where you pour water in is on the face of the bag and the water wants to overflow and slosh out when you get to filling the last third of the bag i had to fill it in a natural spring with rushing water so did not have a water source that you could manipulate it made it a bit hard to fill it entirely all in all it is a great product for camping taking a hot shower in the bush is heaven
its hard to tell sometimes whether a product works or not just after getting some nurserystarted plants we quickly lost two tomato plants and one other vegetable plant the tomatoes were due to a worm that had gone into the branches and was literally eating it from within difficult to figure out what was wrong with the plant at first due to no visible signs of insects we also had some leaf damage to some other vegetable plants in the same garden and after spraying thoroughly with this product that damage stopped progressing though again we never actually found any insectswhat was interesting is that we went away for two weeks and nothing more was applied a friend watered the garden once or twice and there was rain once or twice so theoretically much if not all the protection should have washed off however we came back to zero additional insect damage i dont quite no how to explain that since these appear to be waterbased but the fact is that we currently have the most insect free vegetable garden weve had in many years including a somewhat vulnerable heirloom variety tomato planti have to attribute at least the initial protection to the product i just find it almost too good to believe that the product continued to supply considerable protection over two weeks with multiple waterings including at least one good rain but maybe it did so im giving it a solid star rating due to at least outstanding initial protection with unconfirmed hope that it may even rate the full five stars
i bought this because my ex stole my old boot knife because it was a really high quality item i bought this to see if i liked it and its okay i dont like the plastic sheath the knife is difficult to pull out of it in a hurry and it always comes off whatever it is clipped to belt or boot it does come with a chain and it makes a good necktie knife for when im hiking or out on my motorcycle the blade itself is nice and sharp seems to be good quality the handle had a small nick taken out of it when i took it out of the box but i didnt care too much about that
this watch is an automatic what this means is that it doesnt use a battery and self winds while you are wearing it and moving about if you dont wear it you will need to gently cradle swing it with your hand for about seconds to a minute to maintain the power it works best if you wear it every day if you dont wear it it will eventually stop running usually a day or two you will have to reset the time and date and cradle swing it again to wind it up againi have read the other reviews about time accuracy automatics are not as accurate as a quartz watch an automatic can lose many seconds per month that is a characteristic of an automatic but i dont mind it it is part of the appeal where you bond with the watch if you cant stand taking care of it then a classy automatic is not for you the second hand movement does not have the typical tick style movement but rather it gracefully sweeps across the watch face i can understand the appeal of early chronometers using this type of movement and understand its historic applications for time keepingin terms of looks it is an eye catcher the bright orange face makes it easy to see in the dark or changing light conditions and the luminous markers on the hands and face of the watch holds a bright glow which gently fades after many hours i have woken up early in the morning noticing that the luminescence was still bright enough to read the time easily i have not taken the watch diving or snorkeling yet so i can not comment on water resistance or on dives below feet depth where the light spectrum starts to changethis is my first automatic most of my watches have been quartz powered militarygovernment issue sar watches this watch has the heavy duty look and construction of a military watch but classy enough to wear to work or a night on the town
i purchased this belay device even though i already own theblack diamond apc belay device while the apc is a great model that belays smoothly i wanted something with a little extra bite for those times when im lead climbing and my girlfriend is belayingwell it works great with the ribbed side facing your brake hand the rope stops instantly with little effort on your part if youre looking for smoother rope flow you can flip the device so that the ribbed side is away from your brake hand in this position it acts similar to the atcpersonally i think its worth the extra couple of bucks to get this model over the atc although theyre both great devices
i have carried a swiss army knife in my pocket purse or bookbagbackpack for about years my usual carry has been the tinker because its smaller and lighter in weight i got this explorer because i needed the magnifier and i confess that the hidden pen was also attractive since i often find myself without something to write with as was the end mounted phillips screwdriver the small jewlers screwdriver may have some value for me toofor everyday carry at home in the office at school or camping swiss army knives are simply the best they are solid and made of a high quality steel that lasts and lasts the small cutting blade is simply the best in the businessif i had one wish for a sa knife it is that i had some way to have one custom made with only the tools that want does anyone know if such a service is available and from whom
ive used it a couple times and so far its holding up just fine ill update this ifwhen it breaks or starts to be less effectivemy only complaint is that i apparently dont know how to drain it i put in my white lightning wax ran the chain through it then cleaned it by filling it with water to rinse it out all that did was it put a waxy coating all over the outside of the cleaner haha but i guess i should be wearing rubber gloves anyway so i wont worry about itto clean my chain i use a rag to whipe the outside of the chain first then i fill the cleaner to the line with white lightning wax then run it through then let it dry usually overnight then i whipe the outside of the chain down again with a rag
this mr beams lantern is surprisingly bright this would be great for camping but i use mine when doing things outside the house at night or for use when the power goes out the usb charging port is a plus i plugged in my iphone and it seemed to charge just fine not sure how that affects battery life though i didnt leave it plugged in long enough to find outi like many of the mr beams products and this one is no exception but like all mr beams products youll need to invest in some batteries mine has two modes full strength lighting and dim i usually leave it on bright if you do forget to turn it off the lantern even turns itself off in hour overall i do recommend this product
i went to sears and spent much more to end up with same tools for home shop the craftsman tools are better quality though more and more made in communist red china i know i am old school now to rate this alien this is a great quality tool that will cover most anything needing attention while riding away from home shop yes in my opinion this is a emergency road repair toolkit it will work fine at home but in my mind is for the same bag as spare tubepatch and co tube filler along with a pair of small vice grips i am very satisfied with the alien for the low price in fact i challenge anyone to find a better tool set for less than the i paid at amazon warehouse deals
this whistle is very loud it would work great in a emergency situation and i have no doubt someone could hear it from miles away it is a bit large for a whistle but everything comes at a cost large whistle large noise the bright orange is good so that it will be easier to find if dropped it comes with a little keychain attached but unless you are one of those people who like lots of big things with their keys i would just use this for a lanyard it is a good idea to cover your ears if you intend to blow hard on this when i first got the whistle and tested how loud it could get i caused some ringing in my ears
i have tried many exercise devices over the years some were good and others should have never been invented however the perfect fitness rip deck system is a unique way to do perfect pushups i find that it is much more difficult than the traditional pushup due to the lateral movement as you move downward it kind of reminds me of the strength it takes to do the olympic gymnastics rings only in a prone position if you have any issues with rotator cuff tearing in your past you need to take extreme caution when using this exercise device i for one plan on taking my time with the device and give it months to a year to get to a good workout going
these kettle balls are good enough to get the job done when working out overall these kettle balls arent made for lifetime use like an iron one would be i give them a star because i know they can break cause they are plastic if you treat your equipment with care and dont drop these when working out and set them down they will last a very long time if you abuse them and toss them around theyll eventually break treat your equipment with respect overall and itll prosper just like your wallet and this itemits a good buy i enjoy these i bought them at an aldis store for instead though was a steal
for my hi point c and three mags the latches on the front will snap off if you push up too much on them when opening because they are only secured with plastic on plastic partial hinges hard to describe other than that but it works its light and the padding is sufficient to shield a heavy gun like hi points guns and dont say anything stupid about hi point unless you own one and have a legitimate gripe but how can you have a gripe with a guarantee like theirs theyll fix it or replace it for the life of the gun no matter how many owners it has
i am an hvac tech and thus spend a lot of time working on machines kneeling on concrete floors over the years i have had many types of knee protection all of them come with elastic straps which after a few months stretch out to the point they slide down my legs these too are elastic but at least they come with a way to adjust them and make them tighter time will tell if they also end up sliding down my legs but so far they are great they are comfortable enough that i can wear them under my pants and not have to constantly adjust them
nice smooth rope movement makes it a great device to use for a rappel wide enough for double ropes only thing worth mentioning is that the ring is a perfect circle not the rounded rectangle of the bd super so as unlikely as it is ive only every heard about it it is possible for the ropes to twist up and lock you off midrappel this is something a single prussik could solve and its extremely unlikely so when you add in that this is a bit less expensive then the bd it makes a perfectly acceptable rappel toolsince i weigh and my gf is only i have used it for belay once when someone was borrowing my atc it had very smooth action for taking in slack but not much braking power i would only use for belay in cases like this where the belayer is considerably larger then the climber
had a titan gp i sold to get this i like it soo much better rifle seems to be a more refined version i had bought the titan form wally world when they first came out the stock is way nicer and much better at shoulder than the thumbhole version pressed checkering is grippy i darkened mine with old english scratch cover the wrist may be a little thick for the smallest hands cocking effort is definitely harder than the titan was started using the hold after break in shots currently average quarter size at yards and shrinking with use i did change out provided x centerpoint with a utg xao the cp scope had too thick a crosshair and would cover up target center but will work fine for most casual plinkersi could not part with dollars for an aftermarket trigger using the idea found on youtube for using a washer search for titan trigger i created a better version the guy online had slipped a lock type washer over the triggers combo trigger rolleranti bear trap pin what i did was use a roller from a disassembled bicycle chain it sits lower than his lock washer idea and provides a smooth predictable trigger i also added moly paste to same you want a roller from a bike chain i will offer these for sale in a few weeks it has to be thinned down a little oh i also took out the hairpin spring in the trigger which causes most of the resistance in it do not remove it unless you are going to mod the trigger youll have too much slop and the antibear trap pin will get snaggedhad no issues with having to tighten screws or some of the other faults posted elsewhere maybe i got lucky i would recommend cleaning the bore first mine was quite dirty and greasy from the factory fps averages around with gr pellets and is improving with use i put a couple drops of silicone oil in air chamber for a better seal you can get a tiny bottle of silicone oil here on amazon its made for rc car shocks
this is a great little pump nice and compact it even comes with the hardware to mount it to your bike if that suits you it is set up to mount right under your bottle rack or any other space with the same standard holes tapped the valve does need to be revered to use on a standard bike valve though just unscrew the cap and flip around the valve it looks like it has the option to put on a needle adapter for things like basket balls and stuff and is set that way on default no big deal great pump
i purchased these a few months ago i was leaning towards the bowflex adjustable dumbbells and then saw these i am very happy that i made this purchase of the bad reviews of bowflexall of them dealt with weights falling off and coming close to hitting people these weights seem to be held very firm and i havent had any problem with them falling off or even seeming loose i will probably get the bigger ones later on as my strength increases but this was a good size because i use most of the time the full and my wife is able to use them too with smaller weight the look nice and perform how i would want them too
kay i purchased these locking plugs after both plugs that came with my redline metro classic immediately fell out of the bar on a ride i searched specifically for a locking plug so as that wouldnt happen again considered several came up with these the fact that they are redline going on a redline bike did influence me a little they installed with minimal effort look good hold the tape in dont look to be coming loose or falling out anytime soon i would not install these plugs on any bmx my mountain bike or any of my kids bikes if you do so you may be disappointed these plastic plugs arent meant to hit the ground so install them on your road bike hybrids adult ridden street bikes etc get yourself some alloy bar plugs for anything you like to fall off of
i know theres some people whining saying the handles are hard to put on its common sense to put a little soap on the handles if its hard to get them on i didnt think it was i didnt use any soap and i had them on in minutes theres also people whining saying the grip is rough on your hands again common sense to put gloves on if its that bad i dont think its bad i never use gloves with thisthis is pretty new to me ive used it for weeks now i use it in adition to ab loops that hang from a pullup bar it takes strong abs and good pushup form before you should start using this ive been doing sets of and i would do anymore than that x works a fit person hard enough ive noticed this is the key to getting definition down the middle of your abs good product and really sturdy
this is a great first bike for thomas fans its really easy to ensemble you just have to snap on the wheels and the handle you also have to add on the stickers for the designs once assembled it offers a smooth tide the pedals move easily and its easier to steer there is even a little storage area in the seat so kids can take along their favorite toys the only thing that might be an issue is if your child is in the shorter side my son is but and he was able to reach the peddles but he is very big for his age already bigger than his year old sister and in a size t clothes not sure of his exact height an average child his age wouldnt be able to reach the peddles and because of the big wheel at the front its not easy to push with your feet still a great bike at a really great price
i also own the blackhawk black duty type belt the condor belt is much more flexible and easy to adjust as where the blackhawk is very rigid and the adjustments dont hold as easy in the belt retainers the condor seems to be well made and is comfortable with a pistol drop on one side and molle platform with ar mags on the other i order belt pads to help with comfort but this one would be ok without it the pistol mag pouches are a plus even though i dont use them on the belt overall the belt is an overall good buy and i have never had any issues with the condor product line
ive owned two pairs of these gloves over the past few years the padding is good and for long rides i love them i have experienced very little numbness on rides extending for several hours i use them for both mountain bike and road bike rides but think they do better on the road bike as they have ample padding which is not always a plus when mountain biking the biggest problem i have had has been mentioned here and on other sites the stitching on the fingers has come undone over time when you get the gloves there are strands of thread hanging out thus the finish could be much better there are tags sewed into the glove that are amazing why build a otherwise comfortable glove just to mess it up with these tags not really a big deal im just saying overall i have enjoyed these gloves and believe you get a pretty good for your with these
i ordered a blazer but received an point since simmonsoptics currently lists the point and not a blazer then i must assume they are the same amazon offers them as not identical scopes because they are listed side by side simmons makes a good inexpensive scope but quality does not appear to be consistently reliable as indicated by the discrepancies of different customers ratings the scope is a china product scores vary greatly among buyers i find i now have two x points because of my misunderstanding as i had an point prior to ordering the blazer an point the simmons scope is an above average optic for its price range buyer beware that the point and the blazer are the same scope so pick the best price
this is my second shore power plug for a completely different useso far i have one mounted in the truck acting as my block heateroil pan heater plug bumper mount no more need to lift the hood to plug it in any more or have the cord dangling out of the gtille and as shore power to my shed i simply run a extension cord out to the shed and plug in and voila lights and outlets for this to run conduit and wire hmm and since im only in the shed after dark a few times a year thisll do fine mount it in an exterior code weather box and off ya govery solid product well crafted if the back is going to be exposed to the elements as in a bumper mount get some liquid electrical tape and put it around the seams on the rubber boot
i am very satisfied this mat is perfect for meit did smell a little when i first got it but i really cant see why people would whine about this very minortemporaryaspect of such a superb product i mean do you complain about a car when you get a new car its nothing to get bothered about the only reason i mention it is because from some of the reviews i read it seemed like the smell was going to be a big deal not soi am only and most people my height would get a smaller mat i like to have plenty of room so i got the mat im glad i did in fact if they made a wide mat i would buy that tooi also ordered the xl manduka equa mat towel and i am very happy with that too
i purchased this scope to mount on my dpms ar classic the long eye relief was a major factor in why i made this choice i had previously mounted another scope with around of eye relief and had problems reaching the charging handle of the ar under the scopes eyepiece with the extended eye relief this scope mounted a couple of inches forward of where the old scope was this position keeps the scope out of the way of the charging handle and even allows flipping the iron sights without removing the scope for my use x is just the right amount of magnification and choosing this model over a zoom scope gives me better performance for a scope in this price rangethe scope comes packaged with the rings flipup covers allen wrench cleaning cloth two batteries and a laminated rangeestimating chart for the mildot feature while its not a leupold the view through the scope is decently bright the illuminated recticle is a nifty feature but i dont know if ill actually use it much for daylight use you really wont even need to bother installing a battery overall im very pleased with value of this purchase you get a very usable scope for your dollar
this is the improved version of the gator my friend has the original gator which uses only magnets to secure the saw inside the handlethis version is magnetic and also includes a rubber cap i was initially worried about the saw flying out of the handle while the axe is in use everything fits well and i can safely say the saw is very secure in the handlewhen i first pulled the axe out i was worried about the composite that runs over the top of the axe blade it is extremely thin and i was worried it would not hold very well in the long run it is important to note that the axe blade is anchored into the handle so most of the stress does not impact the thin top coverblades are sharp axe is solid great purchase for backpacking
there isnt too much to add that many of the other reviewers havent covered the initial setup of this was slightly a pain as i had some trouble figuring out at first how to remove the end of the jump rope to tighten it to better fit my heightonce i got things setup it did its job though i didnt have much trouble getting it to the right height once i had the end off and just really needed to cut it a little bit and put it back together after thati havent had any issues since and it seems like its decent enough quality wise especially considering the price
t me begin by saying that i will update my review and possibly give or take away from the star rating as i use this more and morei received the sleeping bag today so theres not much that i can say about it just yet the deer side inside is very soft and warm feeling the brown side looks like canvas but its a semisoft polyester according to the tag cotton polyester covermy issue is that its doesnt seem like its as big and tall as they make it out to be this could be my issue so take this with a grain of salt im and lbs but i like to move around in my sleep and i definitely dont sleep like a mummy i have two little kids and i wouldnt be able to fit either one of them in here with me because they move as well physicallythey fit just fine but we wouldnt be getting any sleep the size says that it is in length but this is when you stretch it out completely pulling it slightly when i laid it flat with nothing bunched up i got a measurement of had to want it to measure for it to do soi like this sleeping bag contrary to what the review might lead you to believe im thinking of buying a second one so that i can pair them together and throw my wife in there with me
i like this kit because its so compact i can leave it in my range bag the construction is good and i dont see it wearing out too quickly the only reason i didnt rate it five stars is because once put together there was a little bit of a rough lip between two of the rods i used a dremel and rounded off the rough edge of the receiver rod and now its super smooth i dont think it would scratch the barrel of a gun since the rods made of brass but i feel better knowing there is no rough patch that could scratch a finish or something
i picked up the twitch a few months ago and its a nice dare i say little knife the blade is very small so id classify it as a light duty knife opening light cardboard boxes cutting twine but im sure it help you slash through a seatbelt if you had no other option available some people say it can be used as a money clip and i have used it as such but the clip is tight and you cant stuff to many bills under itthe knife is well made and can be deployed with a flipper switch or by using the thumb stud being more familiar with the later method it took some practice to use the small studs but now i can use that option without difficulty but its nice to have two ways of opening the knife the blade is satin finished and very sharp and the knife has a surprising heft for it size weighing oz it hides nicely in a pants pocket i do not recommend carrying it clipped inside a pocket as it will probably fall out because i got the excellent sog blink a few weeks ago i dont carry the twitch around too much but when i feel like changing things up and dont think ill be needing a more robust knife ill pick it off my shelf a nice little knif
i got tired of getting lint and dirt and debris in my frame because i have my glock on me doing everything from mowing trimming chain sawing you name it i never had a failure to fire without the plug but i also clean my guns regularly fits super snug actually had a hard time getting it in but does what it is supposed to and i like how it makes the frame more flush and my shirt doesnt get caught in the frame it doesnt add any noticeable weight which is a plus is the plug a necessity no but i like it
this rack is easy to load when only one bike is involved bikes is a pain since i have to remove both hooks to clear the tire when the upright needs to pivot back up for a in med mtb bike you dont want to load the inner bike with the upright up since you will likely scratch your car there is also quite a bit of tweaking that needs to take place when bikes are loaded to keep them from rubbing each other via the tire hoops if you use the locks recommended for this rack it is easy to use the leverage from the lock itself to tighten and untighten the hitch pin to avoid excess swaying no need for a wrench plus the tiny locks give you that nice false sense of security that your stuff is safe if you have a hatchback with no independent window opening your hatch will need to remain closed once the bikes are loaded and during loading i have goofed and loaded the rack with the hatch open which then wont close doh other than these minor annoyances might be major if you always load bikes or access your hatch area often this rack works great for my weekly riding treks i considered the up racks because they look like quality and do everything i needed but at d i would be worried about my bike and the rack getting stolen
i use this bag as a mobile office since i am an outside sales guy this is great i have binders portfolios misc files my ipad charger my giant laptop charger x half liter bottles of water my holster extra mag and my ifak in the condor rip away emt pouch attached to the molle on the end massive carrying capacity nice heavy d construction comfy shoulder strap unless you are trying to overload and wreck it it will hold up to a ton of use my bag usually weighs in at around lbs on a regular basis and its held up quite solid excellent bag
just when i was getting comfy with my nd bushnell trophy scope as the headline stated the reticle selector failed again this is my nd scope the st failed also exactly like this one did soooo ladies and gents my review rates this scope a poor choice for a red dotgreen dot laser scope for my benjamin marauder pcp caliber pistol or any other use for that matter i wish just wish with all my head and heart that i could find a laser scope for that pistol that worked longer than months and then failure attacks with a vengeanceit sucketh big rotten eggs again as i am growing tired of tryingwhen it was working this scope was a joy to use but with a jammed and broken switch that is the only way to select one of the different choices for reticle were supposed to have with this trick scopetrouble is it is just a onetrick pony and that trick is breakage of the switch mentioned in this review you know i dont think ive ever given a star review out yet wellllllthis is the day that changed i hate doing this but i stand by my assessment of this conundrum completelyi even waited a week before i did this review so that i could at least write a softversion of the hard core review that my head wants to publish here so score failures for wavey davey in the bushnell trophy lineupi am not going to mince words either it doesnt feel like the great bargain now does it wavey davey
i went with the guyot designs splashguard after reading reviews of various similar products and im glad i did the alien design isnt something i would have normally wanted at all but i think it goes well with my new glowinthedark nalgene i like smaller mouth bottles because of the ability to drink while in motion but i like being able to easily put ice in a large water bottle and have it be compatible with my water filter and my camping foldable french press so this mouthguard gives me the best of both worlds i can see very small gaps on the sides of the mouth opening which does allow a bit of liquid to trickle out where its not supposed to thats the only thing keeping this from being a star review but its not so noticeable of a problem that it warrants less than starsive dealt with an array of silicone products and know how many dont live up to their claims ie phthalates and funky smells or visible seams this silicone is quality and seems to be durable
i did a lot of looking around and researching before deciding to order these suckers from amazon but i am glad that i did my order was through team solis and shipping was on time and was packaged in a nice small box upon receiving my wayfarers i checked every single aspect of authenticity and these things are real or the worlds greatest fakes the lady at the sunglasses store at the mall told me that i wouldnt find a better price than anywhere ha i ordered these size wayfarers because i have a pretty large head and out of the box even these glasses were a little too small i took the glasses to a lens crafters on my lunch break and they were able to heat and bend the bridge so the sunglasses werent as tight at the temples he also bent the ends of the arms so that they wrap around the back of my ears better preventing the glasses from sliding down my nose they now fit perfectly and look awesome i highly recommend purchasing wayfarers from amazon
this dive computer wont bust the bank and still does the job with both air and ean diving this comes with a code to sign up for a online simulator but also can download an app on the ipad what i dont like about it is if you accidentally ascend too fast the puck locks in to gauge mode for hours and you cant use it for anything other than depth and time i understand the concept but i came up too quickly from around feet and the puck locked up in this mode also the adapter to download your dives to a computer is expensive
i was looking for a solution for commuting i have been using a backpack for a couple months and the shoulders were getting sore anyway i already had the explorer rack so i decided to put it on my bike the trunk works out great only complaints are wish the main trunk compartment was larger its an odd size so you cant really get a set of clothes in that section unless you really fold it tightly but with the panniers down it is great put a full set of dress clothes in one side other essentials in the trunk and rode on to work didnt even notice the offset weight from the one pannier down another issue wish it had a few little extra packets on it all in all it is a great value for the money i have the smaller trunk already i think the smaller trunk has a larger storage area but no panniers
i bought this knife to do my first scale job now i dont even know if i want to waste the wood i showed it to my brother and he immediately said that the only color it comes in i told him it was this knife is shaped well but the red is ugly i told him i was replacing the scales with woodthe pocket clip is ugly dumb and tears even denim in no time the knife is downright painful to open with one hand whoever designed the terraced thumb stud should be fired for incompetence the lanyard hole is laughable unless you rig your knives up with lb test lanyardsi love the shape of the blade and it holds a great edge i can sit down with my ez lap stone and get this thing scary sharp in no time but the bottom line is the knife design excepting the shape is crap
good quick pack for the range as a decent day bug out bag for carrying my blade sharpening stuff all of it and as a pistol range support bag the only thing it doesnt hold is water but seriously carry a separate hydration bag please lol ask the guys coming back from overseas they will be the best ones to advise but in todays world you only need to carry enough crap to allow you to take stuff away from the really stupid not carry all of civilization with you in one bag for someone else to relieve you of your burdens lets keep it real and be safe out there
my son has another collapsible goal which he doesnt use nearly as often as this one the other one is shaped like an arc this is more of a regulation style goal hes the goalie so making a true goal was important for him in practicingfor the overall size of the goal this really does compress down pretty small setup takes minutes once you take it out of the bag the bag could be a little bit larger if you dont get the poles in perfectly the velcro closure isnt effective the corner posts say to insert until they butt against a black line i can not get mine to insert on either side fully they both come short of making this mark not sure if the stickers are misplaced or if they really dont go in far enough these posts do look weird the first time you set them up because they come out at about a degree angle from being straight up and down theyre like tent posts and bend back to frame out the goal to be square one area where i can see being a possible issue is the sleeves in which the fiberglass posts slide into you can already see slopspacing when the goal is loadedbeyond that we really like the goal we have not yet used the rebounder
this is a versatile and practical table for camping or pretty much anywhere for that matter if youre looking for an inexpensive foldup tablein my experience i bought this item and used it the entire summer for camping it served as a table dishwashing table computer desk nightstand food prep and even bread dough kneading surfaceas in the description it can be configured several ways to suite your needs the legs are collapsible and are easily stored under each table section and each leg is adjustable to help level out on uneven groundsurface im restating this part of the description because this the key selling point in my opinion because of the different variations ive used in my experience with this table makes it a musthave item for long term campingthe table is light weight enough but not something for backpacking to be sure its not going to take the place of an oak dining room table either so dont expect that kind of stability or load bearing and speaking of that keep in mind that putting a heavy object on top of the table such as a full dish basin will make the table top heavy when used with the full length of the leg sections the legs will have a under a load but i stabilized the legs with paracordthis is simply done by taking lengths of paracord and securing each leg to one another at the middle screwin attachment on sides of the table leaving the th open for storage access under the table a simple loop in the cord and a gentle tension is all that is needed the cord also made it easy for hanging a dish cloth or any other small wet item doing this did not harm my table in any way but use common sense as with anything this is not a heavy duty item and the lightweight metal and plastic hardware is not meant for suchalso dont set hot off the stove pans on the table surface again common sense the table is not a cooling rack nor is the table a cutting board i used lightweight semi rigid plastic mats found here on amazon but also used simple folded parchment paper for my cutting needs and food prepthis is a coleman product a household name in outdoor gear i dont like everything coleman makes but the majority of their products i find to be good as a low cost alternative and in many instances better performing items than much more expensive brandsthis table served me all summer long at a base camp it will for you too
kay i grew up buying the cheap googles that youd find at walmart or kmart or target etc etc so as you can imagine i never found goggles that i really liked none fit that great even though they were adjustablethen i got these and wow theyre so comfortable they fit perfectly instead of having adjustable rubber notches that are hard to adjust and dont quite fit right these come with detachableexchangeable nose pieces and while theyre a bit tough to pop off they fit awesome now i see the allure of goggles the fit is great no leakage no fogging they feel high quality highly recommended
its pretty neat since it is of better quailty than the other brands from walmart the canvas is thicker and may be more durable and probably can hold up to lbs person it is not a full size cot so i recommend this cot for smaller built person like mei had used it twice since i first got it assembling the cot in the dimlighted person tent was a challenge the disadvantage of this unit is that it is a pain to assemble the supporting side rails and legs if you are not careful to make sure that the holes aligned correctly or if it get twisted while inserting the side rails in the sleeve you will have to do it all over again it also requires some elbow grease to insert the legs into the holes wish the manufacturer has a newimproved design for the side rails and color coding the rails and holes will be a great feature tooit is a great item to have for tent camping no more sleeping on the hard ground
nalgene has two variants of the stainless steel single walled noninsulated container this version has the tapered bottom the other version is more cylindricalthe stainless is very solid the lid screws on tight and there are no leaks the cord is handy to carry and to keep from losing the lid you can loosen the cord and remove the lid if youre dishwashing or boiling water in itwe keep the singlewalled unit in the car and on camping trips as in an emergency you can remove the lid and boil water in this thing the metal will get hot so dont pick it up bare handed plus the quart size is perfect for purification tabletsas its singlewalled and noninsulated it does condensation with cold liquids and is cold to the touch conversely hot liquids heat up the metal making it hard to holdif you want an every day driver bottle for the car that doesnt sweat or heat up too much get the doublewalled insulated version if you want a you can cook with in an emergency then look no further there are less lid options than the brand but i love the fact that these just dont leakalways good to have multiple forms of in a survival or camping situation these look great and have a great number of uses for a camping trip or a survival kit
i love everything about this bottle the feel the color the taste of water from it the wide mouth easy to fill with ice the flip top the drink openingi just wish it was came in a larger size than oz but even so the size makes it easy to carry around and wrap your hand around i bought insulated carriers from walmart which helps keep the ice cubes solid longer and the water colder i have this in colors i wish they offered more colors ill definitely be buying more of them i drink water all day and refill this at least x a day a great purchase and also a good gift idea for anyone who loves to drink water
ive been using this cooling towels on very hot and humid days when working in my yard the towel actually does feel cool to the touch when damp and left to hang a few minutes i then drape it around my neck and it is noticeably cooler than my sweat drenched shirt this is not like putting a towel drenched in ice water on your neck but for me this really did provide relief and cooling at a moderate levelhow i use it i use the hose to soak the towel then i squeeze about most of the water out so that the towel is still damp to the touch and has a little water weight to it i drape it across something so that it can start the evaporationcooling effect and then drape it around my neck i dont know if letting it start evaporating on its own is really needed for the effect but that is the process i go throughsince i sweat into this i make sure i rinse it with clean water after use i havent had to wash it yet but other reviews say it stands up well to a washing machine i would not put this in a dryeri am happy to own one and love to show it to my friends the price seems to be an easy and accessible price to just go try one
i got this pot and found it difficult to keep a consistent temperature as the lead level went down without substantial tweaking of the rheostat knob i installed a mypin pid thermal controller with a k style thermocoupling and now i set the temp on the pid and the temperature is maintained perfectly with the rheostat opened up fully from the start of the lb pour all the way to the bottom with the pid controller in place i get consistent pours at a nice even temperature through the whole pot without turning the dial i basically installed the pid in the cart that i cast on wired an extension cord through the ssr relay and plug the pot in the cord this way if theres a failure on the pot i can just plug another one in the place and i didnt have to modify the melteraka voiding warranty if i didnt have the pid in place it would have been a star because of the variability but then again with how inexpensive this melter is in comparison with the other brands with digital controllers this is a steal the pid controller costed me about to make less amazon points
used these in the military before to clean threaded inserts on missile builds maintaining small arms came packaged in sealed paper bag that can be autoclaved for sterlized applications has the autoclave temp mark nice stiff swabs that have a tight wrapped cotton taper tip price is right for me to keep packages in a med kit loading bench weapons cleaning box great for getting into the nooks crannies that most reloading gear small arms other tight places that need cleaning or lube application made in the usa one can tell by the quality ive used others from a local supply made in china with great disappointment typeiii products shipped them rather quickly were concerned about customer satisfaction they appear to be a government contract supplier highly recommend these swabs
i bought this system for my mtb bike as my group rides at night through very dark trails this light has them all envious i also use this on my road bike at night and set it to the rapid blink for safety and it still gives enough light in that mode to see anything ahead well in advancerecharge time is fairly quick i have never let it run all the way down and only charge it every to daysi am very happy with this product and highly recommend itupdate after a years of use this light is still going strong and i would give this stars if they let me last month i did finally pull off the usb rubber cover by my own doing i was going to charge it before a ride and i accidentally pulled it from the wrong side and pulled it off i contacted the cygolite support team via email and they sent me another one at no cost even after years of use and well out of warranty they still stood behind the product and made sure i was content even when they didnt have to a stellar product and stellar customer service hard to find nowadays
while i would not consider these cheap in price there are plenty of others that cost a whole lot more and you would assume that they are probably expensive for a reason i bought these in the high size because a previous set of rings in med were just touching the stock sight on my marlin these are different in design from anything i had seen before and i thought it looked quite nicei am not disappointed in the least they better on the gun than they do on amazon the fit was perfect for my needs and they look great they seem to be very well made and i have no worries about them lasting for years i have a feeling i will be ordering more of them for some of my other scoped rifles
i never expected these to shoot exactly where my field tips did but i thought they would be somewhat close i was a little put off by the extreme sight changes i had to make between the ft and bh now the reason i gave it a star instead of a lower rating is because i am certainly no bow expert and i am aware that the variance could be a simple oversight on my part with that being said i did have some pretty bad groups and they were not very consistent given my years of experience with a small variety of bows the bow i shot these tips through was my bear assault just fyi i did shoot a nice little spike using this bh but never recovered it now i wont blame that on the bh because there were a number of things that could have gone wrong with that shot you just had to be there
hoppes oil for firearms is well known so i wont go into that i have used this brand for over years on my firearms i am writing about this handy little bottle with metal tipped dispenser the metal dispenser tip has a very small hole you can precisely add just the right amount of oil without accidentally over oiling also the metal dispenser tip has a red rubber cap to seal it after use very handy my oil usage has decreased this is much better than the plastic bottles with a plastic tip one drop from the precision metal tip vs the plastic tip bottle that comes in many gun cleaning kits is about the amount i buy the bigger bottles of hoppes to refill this little guy as the bottle lasts a long time especially good on tiny parts semiautos etc
i like is case for smaller rifles and a pistol with all of their accessories i usually carry a couple plastic or military style rifles in this casei say plasticmilitary meaning durable such ars aks keltec sub or sus msar stg it has adjustable straps that hold one rifle securely but when you get two in there they tend to bang around a bit not bad but it doesnt hold them like a hard case and they shift and firearms will sometimes touch each other i would not put a prized firearm or high dollar wood stock in this case its too short to hold really long rifles or shotguns this case doesnt scream gun case which i like and in fact i put it on like a back pack and take it with me into my indoor soccer center instead of leaving my firearms in the car only a few people guess that the bag contains firearms it has plenty of pockets pistol holster and adjustments that make this a neat and handy bag enjoy
i added these to my home gym a few months back and i love them i read some reviews saying that the straps would come loose but i have had no problems you have to look at the latch and follow the directions and you will be fine i have them on the front of my squat cage for now so i cant do every exercise i want to they come with plenty on strap and im sure i could hang them on something much higher ive jumped on them very vigorously and they hold just fine i recommend them and would buy them again
i got my cargo carrier delivered without too much troublei had faxed in a signature release but the driver missed iti had the trucking company reschedule as it was their fault and was delivered the next daymy first impression is that this carrier is short for an sq box and is taller than mostthis will probably work out as i intend to using for some large itemsit looks a little chunky on my rig a vw vanagon camper this may work out as i have room for another rack system for surf boards or other things it is more intended for mid to large sedans or suvsinstallation was easy and was on in minutes seems solid when closed and locked but a little flimsy when openas for value i would say that these items are overpriced to begin with its a sellers market for sureall in all i am a happy customer and can now store a lot in the cargo box instead of inside my vanif the price was under i would recommend it to friends that is what i think its worth
i have the leather version of this pouch which looks nearly identical mine has a rugged velcro fastener and fits the large champion knife and instructions paperwork with maybe a halfinch width room to spare so the clothnylon version with a bit more tapered bottom should also fit the larger swiss knives the more narrow but very capable victorinox huntsman knife might leave enough room to also hold a butane lighter beside the knife in this pouch my leatherman blast is about inch wider and inch longer same thickness depth toward belt and it also fits in this pouch but does better in its customsized leatherman leather pouch
wesome paddle for the money sturdy enough to use it to enter your kayak without fear of bending the shaft which is rare for a paddle with an aluminum shaft its not too heavy at all best bang for the buck i used to recommend people the bending branches whisper for a good beginner intermediate spare paddle but this one is x better in my opinion definitely a good buy only gripe i have is that the picture of the paddle does not accurately represent its color it doesnt have fade from dark orange to the lighter orange its solid orange all the way across the reviews that mention a bend in the shaft are correct however this bend is intentional and as soon as you take your paddle out on the water you will see why its there and appreciate it
just bought a sw mp lr wanted to mount a red dot but not spend a lot of money been to the range twice now and very pleased with my purchase decision installation simple and took me about rounds to get it dialed in it feels and looks solid the battery already came installed which seemed strange the voltage was fine and it looked brand new for the price and mounted on a low recoil rifle i think i made a good choice i like the rubber cover that goes over the lens this keeps it protected when cleaning the gun and in my travel case if it holds to my settings ill be very pleased a few more hundred rounds will better answer that question
if you have a nice large table to set it up on it works fairly well but the way the elevation is set and locked in will shift your point of aim off higher then you wanted and usually to the right it will also flex between front and back for a rimfire rifle this works well enough for anything heavier it just wont hold up better to spend a bit more and get something bettermy knocked the back block clean off and this was with all of the screws holding the green arm down the middle to the grey parts it broke at the screw holes
this mag pouch easily holds four of my poly ak round mags they both fit in each slot easily there is a separator flap so the mags dont touch but if you put both mags in each slot with the mags touching there is room enough left over to slip my double stack glock mag in the separator slot along with the two mags so you can now get a feel for how deep the pocket is the material is of good quality the top flap has both velcro and snaps to secure it there are four molle attachment straps on the rear that snap closed it is only inches wide and leaves room on your drop leg platform for other items buy with confidence
i waited a few weeks for this review because i wanted to break in the knives a bit so i could fairly compare this with other knives since cutting ability is the most important feature of a knife i did a cutting comparisoni chose to test the straightsmooth blades of the chefs knives because serrated knives tend to work well even over time without sharpening i took the chefs knife from this set and the ceramic victorinox knife that i own which my kids call the terrorist knife because its so sharp and a cutco chefs knifei cut some chewy artisan bread with each knife sawing slowly and applying a light amount of pressure i felt the lighter knives did the best with the ceramic knife the lightest performing a hair better than the cutco but then i tried more dense foods like summer sausage and hard cheese and it seemed like the heavier forged knife from this set performed a little better the heavier weight kind of held the knife down to the surface and kept it in place as i cut down it was easier to cut even slices with this forged knife for the cheddar which is a medium weight cheese all knives seemed equally as good so my conclusion is that for the ideal ease in cutting you should match the weight of the knife with the densityweight of the food that said all three knives performed wellfor feel the ceramic knife is very lightweight will supposedly hold its sharpness the longest and its cool but i know it can break easily from being dropped or even in the dishwasher the cutco is medium weight i love the elegant white handles and they sharpen their knives for a nominal fee for the life of the product this victorinox set excels in feeling solid and looking as sturdy as it feels i thought i would not like a heavier weighted set but i do enjoy working with it and the knives give you a feeling like they will last forever sleeki give it stars knocking it a little because the lighter knives were a little better at the bread
if but it was for my friend and he seemed to really like it i honestly its a piece of plastic crap and i would not get it for a paintball markera bbairsoft gun or any rifle with a picatinny rail system but i gave it a star becausemy friend liked it and get what you pay for its functional but seems really flimsy and looks like it would break easy buy it if you want a cheap sight and are short on cash but you could pay twice which is still not much what you pay for this and get one made of metal that would be much more effective and worth your money
wesome flashlight this seems very well built even had greased threads i am a bit of a flashlight freak and i continue to increase in lumens with every light i buy my last every day carry light was a fenix pd good light lumens but this absolutely blows it out of the water this thing lights up the freaking block i have found my new carry light for sure i will update this review as this is the first day i have owned it but if this light is as reliable as my fenix or my streamlight protac i will be a nitecore fan for life just buy this and be happy you have the sun in your pocket
i usually avoid paying more than for a pair of sunglasses branding really doesnt affect my purchase decision so i tend to stick with sunglasses that fit my face and block the sun anything above that is just a bonustwo factors led me to break down and spend more on the smiths i had a chance to try this model on at a retail store where they were almost double the price they were comfortable and fit nicely the replacement warranty its tough for me to find sunglasses that fit well and when i do i tend to wear them daily inevitably theyll get scratched or bent and then i have to hunt down a new pairsmith optics offers lifetime repairs so it was a relief to know that if i scratch a lens or break a nosepad i can send these in for a pairnow that ive had them for a few weeks i really wish id bought them sooner they feel solid but lightweight theyre clearly built to last and very comfortable to wearif i had one complaint its that the polarization doesnt seem as powerful as on other sunglasses ive owned theres some reduction in reflected light but its not really noticeable
i finally got a chance to test it in a real world situation where frozen items had to stay frozen in order to not have to eat them all immediately i am talking marie callanders pot pies several of them it wasnt real warm today but the trunk time ended up being a full hours i did not have a blue ice pack so i used some frozen soup in a tupperware as my freeze block after hours the freeze block looked the same as when i had pulled it out of the freezer and the pot pies were still hard as a rock huzzah i dont have to die from a sodium overdose by eating them all i will still knock it down a star as it is pricey and some of the thermal bags out there also do a decent job the box will probably be most useful when taking hot food over the river and through the woods but you may find you need the biggest one for that and it is definitely pricey at that size hopefully with the currency wars in full swing this german import will be much cheaper in the near future
the ad is a compacted plastic version of schwinns large rugged allmetal airdyne exercise bike which was introduced in airdynes use large fans as the source of resistance instead of mechanics brake pads or flywheels as a result they can provide the sensation of actually bicycling because the faster you pedal the more air resistance you encounterout of the box the ad is a cool looking futuristic version of the venerable airdyne i found it much easier to assemble than some of schwinns other exercise bikes such as the with most of the parts fitting perfectly there was one broken piece a noncritical black plastic ring which caps the seat posthowever i found the ads performance to be only mediocre on the plus side the whoosh of the air is calming and refreshing while the ability to engage your arms to crank the fan is unique you can get a decent workout if you keep at it however i still found my legs doing the majority of the pumping to build up enough momentum while my arms just kind of flopped back and forth you can not disengage or adjust the amount of resistance for either the upper or lower body so theres no way around thisthe smallerfatter fan size means it has to rotate faster to produce the same amount of resistance as the original and hence it is considerably louder as a result this bike will fill a room with loud gusty noise its not as advertised the seat is also no great shakes admittedly im and weigh lbs but its bound to make most anyone a bit sore after ten minutes for me it was six there is no bottle holder and the computer readout is very simple cycling through the but it is easy to read from a distancei think the ad is a compromised version of a highlyregarded classic mine already has a bit of a in the left pedal which is a common problem with schwinns and other lowend exercise bikes you should also be aware of the schwinn nautilus warranty stipulations involving after days which you can read more about in my review of the my guess is that the ad is less prone to mechanical failure than some of the more complicated models but i am unimpressed with its overall workmanship and ride
these are pretty expensive for what you get a knife a pen just the refill barrel basically a pin a needle wouldve probably been more useful a clumsy little tool for a screwdriver a magnifier a small led lamp tiny scissors ohh and the classic swiss army knife tweezerthere is no nail file and no tooth pick despite the description saying there isit shouldve had some kind of can bottle opener and a fire steel flint or something like thatits an ok little wallet tool it does fit in my decidedly overstuffed wallet i also have a creditcard sized calculator thats just as thick as this tool card and a lot of plastic cards and other things in there but its somewhat disappointing and could have been better designed for this pricei only give it stars for being too expensive and too few features
superior bike mirror if you are worried about the installation dont all the tools are provided and the parts are easy to assemble if you dont want to buy the mirrycle because you have to cut your grips get over it being able to see who is coming up behind you while bike riding is a luxury you cant afford to bypass after your initial installation you will have to retighten occasionally as the natural vibration of the road loosens the mechanism this mirror is fully adjustable and in my opinion is the best purchase you can make towards saving your own life on the road

ill give this a handle rail a star not because its exceptional but for the priceit was packaged well and looked like it was crafted nicely but it wasnt also came with a nut washer for bottom screw ass i was putting it on i noticed it had screws on each side which i have no use for and when i mounted it on i noticed it has these lines engraved on the side of rail which are suppose to be flush when mounted the only good thing about it is i can still use my iron sights still mount an optic on top
i purchased these for a recent trip to washington dc with my daughter and two granddaughters in the hope that they would help keep us warm they exceeded my hopes we put them into our coat pockets when we left early each morning and they were still warming us when we returned after dinner i honestly dont know what we would have done without them we are from coastal california so are unaccustomed to very cold weather dc weather took a dramatic dip while we were there with temps not exceeding degrees and hovering in the degree range with a windchill in the negative numbers there was snow and slush yet we stayed remarkably comfortable between these warmers for our hands and insulated insoles in our shoes the warmers do remain warm for more than ten hours we loved them and believe they are an easy star product my daughter has since purchased more of them for her girls to take to school on chilly days
if you need a nice carrying case for the back of the truck this will work if you want something to protect your firearm while hiking or for long time storage there are other options the problem is they are expensive options for the price this does its job and does it well a little flimsy when open after it is locked down the padding and shell reinforce it well nice looking and sturdy for a short trip the shell it not heavy and the seams need help matching but these are not real issues for what you are using it foragain if you need a weatherproof hard case and dont mind paying almost then this is not your case if you need a short term storage and carry case this is for you
i bought this to align the laser on my bg the bg laser was way off evident at the rangeload the round through the top with the gun open not easy to get in out at least for it should be much more easy its just a laseri dont know about everyone else but i cant get the lasers to line up perfectly at all distances line it up close its off far line it up far its off close so had to line it up in to a point where i have to predict will be the distance i may need it to work however the laser lines up great with the metal sights
how many different devices can count your steps calories burned distance traveled blah blah blah there are smartphone apps that do it there are pedometers that do it there are watches that do it there are other gadgets that do it so what makes this one so special not much really when i asked my wife what she thought after using it for a few weeks she was at least still using it though not religiously so below is what my wife reportspositives allows you to input a week goal against which the device will measure your progress reports progress each daypercentage of steps vs your goal goes into blank screen mode automatically to conserve batteries yet still works when the screen is blank holds days worth of data after which you need to download data from the unit senses when you are working out and goes into workout mode where it reports your activity during the workout very smallfits easily into pocket or into belt clipnegatives falls out of belt clip much too easily our kids find it lying around the house all the time doesnt work for cycling which is an activity that my wife enjoys doing hence you get no tracking of your cycling purple maybe there is no man who would want this device anyway but if there were he would change his mind when he saw purple no wow factor personally if i wanted to track my movement i would download an app to do this i believe there is one for the iphone called move
while this is called a pool basketball set it is not much different from the regular sklz mini basketball set other than the blue and white color schemeit is straightforward to assemble and adjust although there are some potential pinch points particularly when installing or removing the middle extension tube the instructions do state that two people may be required for attaching the top pole with backboard so i think they are aware of the issue in addition the instructions are complete but off at times color of cap and somewhat confusing after a bit of head scratching i just winged it and used the instructions for reference i also used my own tools after a few tries with the included setinstead of sand or water for the base i used a bag of small rocks it is less messy than sand and shouldnt form algae mildew or mold the base definitely requires some fill material in or on the base otherwise it is not stable and easily tips over the base is not too large and the wheels help move the unit aroundwe have found this a good set to use by the pool and standalone elsewhere in the backyard we have a x above ground endless pool and this is a fun diversion it should help to improve shooting accuracy since missed shots often result in a face full of water either that or well all be turning our heads to the side when we miss for standalone use it is equally fun its a blast to dunk and fun even just shooting around the adjustable height covers just about everyone
i just bought a new windsor wellington bike last month the bike has a shimano sti shifter the mirror mounts fine on this shifter i was skeptical after reading the reviews and the warnings from mirrycle that it wont work on shifters newer than the wasnt listed as one of the models this mirror would work on either after much research i decided to give this a shot and ordered it i love my mirrycle bar end mirrors on my other bikes i took pictures and was going to post them but it appears that amazon doesnt allow you to upload pictures anymore thats too bad it would have been helpfulif youre not sure about this working on your sti go to the mirryclecom website click on the picture of this mirror and click on the assembly instructions link if the installation picture looks like what you have this mirror will most likely fit your bikei held back star because i wish the horizontal arm of the mirror was a couple of inches longer as my arm is partially blocking the view in the dropdown position i havent tested this on the road yet as its january in ny i dont do ice and snow my biggest concern is the bike falling over and snapping off the top of my shifter sooner or later my bikes always fall over its usually the wind but sometimes i fall over tooas with the mirrycle bar end mirror the screws go in hard they are made that way so they dont vibrate loose except for the mm screw that holds it onto the shifter that will probably come loosei will add an update when i road test this some reviewers have commented that it comes loose after a while if it does i will put some nail polish on the screw it works like loctite except the screw is easier to remove if you have to take it aparthope this helps
this acog scope rubber cover does what it is made for and claims to doie covers seals and protects the ocular and objective lenses of acog scope i own a very well made replica of the trijicon x acog for all intents and purposes it is made externally to the exact same dimensions as the real deal xobviously the internal technology is far from exact this scope cover fits my scope like a glove the ocular and objective lenses are tightly sealed and well protected the cover installs quickly and doffs just as quickly at the moment i do not have a bad word to say about this productcertain other reviewers have seen rubber deteriorization especially in the strapbands i have not seen this at all as of yet i have not used any oil or water based rubber sealants or protectants as some have intimated these products may hasten the deteriorization certainly if i see the aforementioned deteriorization begin i will immediately update this review however at this time considering the fantastic price ease of use and level of lens protection i can give nothing less than stars to this product
i am homebound quite often so having something that is easy care comfortable and warm enough but not hot was priority price was a strong consideration as well do note i ordered one pair of these as often if i try to order several i end up disappointed and being homebound cant get stuff sent back in a timely fashion so end up losing out then having to figure out if the items are even worthy of charity then hoping i get the stuff in before it piles up i wish shopping was simpler in this case it washmm i was going to write that if you have bigger hips you should order bigger than typical waist size no need in reviewing my order it seems i accidentally ordered a size smaller than what i usually order they are a bit tight but comfortable as in how jeans fit i have been losing weight if it hasnt been showing up when measuring waste or so it seemed i am going to have to say i think these things fit just about exactly as they should now that i cleared that up well and i actually feel better even if my waste measurement continues to tell me otherwise about my size take it where you can get itpajamas to pants these really impressed me and yeah i am picky actually i would have no other problem than ego of wearing these downtown to me i have made them into my pajamas and wearing pajamas out just seems wrongthank you fruit of the loom wonderful encore
fter a year and a half of occasional use my tlr lost its ability to hold zero for windage with the laser fortunately this product has a lifetime warranty and can be sent back to streamlight for diagnosis and a fix though that has yet to happen yet on the list of things to do howeverthat said i decided to investigate picking up a new unit and ultimately settled on a surefire x albeit at a significantly discounted price thanks to an employee purchase program still it wasnt chump change for the x especially when considering the fact that i still have a tlr that in theory will be as good as new after it gets back from its spa treatment at the factoryunfortunately for the streamlight by picking up the x i learned first hand a thing or two about a firearm lightlaser combo should be made the controls of the surefire are worlds away from the manner that the streamlight does things and even on the nastiest most ornery kicking guns i own it just keeps working exactly like it should of course for its normally five benjamins price tag again i paid far less than that it had betterbut what the surefire really did was spoil me and made me look at the tlr in a vastly different light the streamlight when working correctly is still a capable unit but the switchgear that it uses is far less convincing a solution than how the x handles things and the tlrs overall bulk doesnt score brownie points with me given the x slightly smaller size and especially in light of new designs from viridian and others now on the marketthe reality is that i paid less for the x than i did for the tlr while the streamlight is serviceable its not the pinnacle i initially thought it to be and given the windage pot breakage its fallen down even more spots on my own hit list while it worked fine in all conditions that i used it in i find that its really hard to regain that faith that was shattered when something breaks particularly when it comes to ones firearms and related equipment starswith adjustments as needed after the unit returns from streamlight
i love this bagits incredibly light folds up way way smaller than i was expecting and when open has a reasonable amount of space for magazines etc the lidtop has a good amount of velcro for securing the bag while it is either rolledup or opened and includes a nice long pull handle to make sure you wont fumble getting it openi was hesitant to order it because im no longer active so the only time ill need a drop bag for magazines is if the chinese invade or the zombies rise but because it folds up so small and gives you a good amount of space unrolled i figured it would be good for hiking traveling etc and i was right it will absolutely do the job so it wont be attached to my armor fulltime itll be getting used insteadi would have given it stars but the damn thing does not come with molle clips it has the threadingstrapping on the back for pairing with your molle gearbut you will have to buy the clips separate so figure the bag actually costs you bucks more than you think youre spendingthat is not cool still im happy i bought it
i loved this knife when i got itwaited and learned about cold steel with much respect for the company everything was great till a small drop and then then blade was locked in and i could not activate the mechanism to close it i sent two emails to cold steel both very respectdful and appreciative asking for help with no response i also found out the the cold steel locking mechanism much praised by cold steel has a small spring that can break or get jammed making the knife useless my son loves cold steel and turned me on to them honestly as a business ownermyself the lack of response made me feel bad and took away from the mystique and feelings i read rave reviews about cold steel and dont want to put them down this just kinda sucked
i just received this dip bench and was a little apprehensive due to the price i was worried about it possibly being cheaply made and poorly finished this particular product is less than half the price of an almostidentical product sold alongside of ithowever once i had it puttogether i can say that this is a wellbuilt solid piece of fitness equipment fitandfinish are very good and it seems completely solid when in use no shaking or wobbling in the middle of a dip rep i am sure that there are much better pieces of workout equipment out there but i dont think that there are better pieces of workout equipment for the price there is absolutely no reason to spend more money on a different more expensive dip bench
we needed a tent that could house five people two adults and three kids and still provide room to grow those kids arent getting any smaller this tent did all of that and moresetup was very easy if you have ever set a tent up before this one will not be any different it is a two person three makes it a lot easier job if you are looking for a bit of a struggle you could do it with one person but i would not recommend itonce everything was setup beds in place back packs and camping supplies in the tent we still had plenty of room to move around and we were not stepping on anything or anyone for the camping trip we were on we had a lot more stuff that we normally would if this was a hiking trip so if this was a hiking trip we would have had even more roomwe woke up one morning to rain not a monsoon or a torrential downpour but a significant rain and we could not find any leaks anywhere the rain fly did a great job and the windows and seems all held up fine when we took to the tent down the next day we noticed that there was a puddle of water under the tent on top of the ground tarp we laid out even with a puddle under the tent we did not get any water in the tent very pleased with that take down was as easy as setup it is very easy with two people three makes is that much easier folding the tent was a bit of an issue you might want to take pictures of how it is folded before you set it up the first time it will help getting everything back in the packagevery happy with this tent looking forward to our next trip
the microfiber weave of the review sample that i received is similar in feel to chamois i have the larger size and its perfect for yoga but also as a car seat protector when you are at the beach in fact the long narrow size makes them a perfect fitas a towel they dry you off then quickly dry out when hung over a towel rack or shower curtain rod i machine washed and dried mine with no other articles and the lint trap in my dryer was very clean so the fiber is very tightly woven do note that the instructions recommend that you air dry these but i had to test them outi love the soft feel as a towel but as a yoga mat the fabric can be a little slippery the weight of the fabric is about medium for a microfiber cloth but will not stay in place when using it for other purposes like a simple mat for doing situps and pushups especially the latter where the towel will bunch and is a bit too slippery to be effectivehowever as a towel or seat protector its perfect and i love them on the beach because its easy to shake sand out of them one of them is now being used as a dust cover for myroland rdnx digital pianoand its a perfect fit i am so pleased with this set that i awarded them five stars and will recommend them to friends
my wife and i have used of these zipped together for camping seasons now and these are the warmest most comfortable sleeping bags ive usedthe second one we bought though i had to send back to amazon and replace because the zipper was defective and wouldnt zip back up the replacement has worked perfectly this year our first one had its handle break not a big deal but a minor inconvenience defects aside the quality of materials the cotton canvas shell the filling and the soft cotton liner are very good and i expect they will last us yearsthe size of the bag is also awesome especially since i am i fit in it great it is also quite wide so a bigger person will likely fit both my wife and i can fit in one of these but it is a little cramped and we prefer more space so we zip of them togetheroverall as a sleeping bag this is great we havent tried it down to its low rating degrees f but weve used it in the s and have been very warm i wouldnt recommend this for weather warmer than the upper s or low s or youll be hot
i am a very large person who tried to take a karate class to lose weight gave up after a few weeks too strenuous needed lighter activity i couldnt see because the sweat kept pouring into my eyes and wrist bands although i like them generally become tight whenever im doing exercises this headband didnt confine me like the wristbands did no fault of them its my size the headband gobbled up a ton of sweat but it gave out on me after the first minutes which is extraordinary because i sweat profusely when i move for the average person this will carry you through a marathon highly recommended looks good
if you travel in the wilderness or go far beyond civilization keep this in your kit otherwise add to your earthquake flood hurricane kit great survival food that keeps for a long time vaccuum packed in metal foil pouch rated lower since it tastes like cookie dough too much like all of the and energy bars on the market also the single package is not resealable even though it includes multiple a recloseable pack would be better days of food are in here but it is always tempting to just eat the whole thing since it is already opened it also is not labeled to be easily noticed as food in a survival situation this might get left as it appears to be first aid supplies or medical in nature due to the plain blue on white writing as survival food i have sampled this but have not had to live on it yet
i bought this kit for my husband after our first camping trip and my husband forgot to bring a mallet and broom and dustpan and the stakes that came with our tent all bent the first time we tried to hammer them inits nice to get it all in one little sack so we dont forget anything i have since decided a large broom and battery operated hand vac suits my taste better than a little broom and dustpan but those are still handy to have aroundthe stakes in this kit are sturdier than the ones that came with our tent ie they dont bend easily the mallet works and we have no problem with itthe stake puller works but only if the stakes arent stuck in the ground the last time we used it the stakes wouldnt come out and we were afraid plastic heads on the stakes would come off with the stake puller it would be nice if either the stake heads werent made of plastic or the stake puller would grip stake body so we could get a grip on the stake and pullother than the problem with removing the stakes i have no complaints
it love it love it this item is excellent for redgreen dot sights that need to be raised to eye level i recently purchased a new generation utg redgreen dot sight system for my ar platform and needed a riser that would also allow the sight to become quick detachable this product meets all those needs for me and more not only does this riser bring the optic to the eye level without messing up the alignment of the sight with the bore but it also makes the sight easier to put on the rifle and take off at the same time the quick release lever works well and can be adjusted to fit your needs as a shooter i know this riser has slots which will fit most redgreen dots but just ensure you have days to return the product in case it does not work out for your particular set up it fit my utg optic just fine and has made it very easy to both use and detach from the rifle after using the rifle to run n gun a couple times the redgreen dot did hold zero so this riser is pretty tough to take the recoil from a centerfire rifle not sure how it would perform with caliber but its all aluminumaluminium so it should have no problems all in all a great product that is highly recommended
ye protection is the number one most important gear item in any airsofters load out full seal eyepro foam touches skin all around the eye socket is a standard requirement for almost all airsoft venues and these mesh goggles are great mesh means absolutely no fogging or loss of vision during a match it takes your eyes about minutes to adjust to looking through the mesh but after that adjustment time you barely even notice there is anything between your and your opponents the elastic strap provides great retension and the adjustable nature allows a snug fit on all size heads these goggles work great with halfface masks tucking under the mask and leaving little to no exposed skin great buy and let me tell you that youll love having them when you take a bb to the face and dont feel a thing
for the bucks i spent on this seat i would say it is an excellent seat it is not particularly lightweight not extremely comfy not extremely anything but its a good seat comfy enough for long rides light enough to not make a real difference in my riding i would definitely buy one again as a matter of fact this is my second one and will likely when the time comes be my third my first lasted me years of riding i am a moderate rider in season i do about miles of mountain biking per week off season i probably average about miles per week
i bought this originally for my springfield ma socom ii but started using it on all my pistols as well i carry an hk pm daily and was used to my pistol being pretty dry most of the time just because regular gun oil evaporates quickly in the hot climate of the deep south after lightly running this over the barrel and inside of the frame i noticed the gun staying slick for months now my cleaning workflow involves spraying some regular gun oil into the tiny places of the pistol then lightly greasing the major areas every few months its working out great this stuff is expensive but a small tube as lasted me a while and there is still plenty left
just received january while good to have it comes with an expirationbest used by date of whatever that may mean for something like this i plan on keeping it sealed as it came with hopes of never having to use it anyway but as once having a life serious threatening injury with much loss of blood this is darn good to have life saving would i care about the use by date in the event of a serious need for such an item uh probably not better than not having again i will store it sealed as it came i also placed it in a ziplock plastic bag and stowed as part of my st aid kit
i have a lower back issues slipped vertebrae and a herniated disk that makes standing for more than about half an hour very uncomfortable sitting or squatting makes the pain go away but you cant always find a place to sit and squatting is hard on the knees for more than a minute or two this little stool is just the thing i neededits small smaller than a loaf a bread when collapsed and folded light about as heavy as a loaf of bread seriously and extends to a comfortable height its comfortable enough to sit on and relatively stable very stable on a hard surface but a little wobbly in soft dirt or on gravel i use it for all kinds of purposes ive taken it places i know i wont find places to sit to relieve my pain i use it out fishing to sit on as i put on and remove my waders ive even used it around the house when i need to sit or get low to work on something or do some chore with the legs collapsed you can get pretty low and keep the strain off your knees instead of squatting or kneeling it will hold a lot of weight so even bigger people can use it safely the stuff sack has cords that can be used to sling this over your shoulder or wear it like a small backpacki love this thing and wish id found it a long time ago its every bit as good as promised
for a bike rider who likes to do some of their own maintenance this is a great buy the fold up aluminum frame is sturdy easy to fold up and store and it will handle all of my bike ranging in size from kids trainer to a full size mountain bike the clamp its orientation could be a little easier to adjust but it may be as much me not doing it correctly as it is the design regardless that does not effect my satisfaction with the product the stand is not professional quality of course but it is a winner for any rider doing some or all of their own maintenance highly recommend
s i was only going to be out days and didnt have the money to spend on a true ultralight backpackers tent i thought this would sufficefor the most part it did though on night i split a pole luckily with some duck tape i managed to get through the trip but this tent will be promptly replaced by something higher qualitythis tent was fine for a short trip and a type situation if you are going to be using this tent a lot i suggest searching for one of higher quality that said for a lightweight tent it sufficed for my week hike

im not sure id use the cadence maybe one day for now i just wanted a nice little speedometer this thing works a charm it set up fine the cable could be an inch longer for my bikes frame on a frame with it mounted at the base of my bikes handlebar stem i cant turn the handle bars all the way to the right or the cable is taught i could probably undo the wire and run it more obviously along my frame i have it with the cables under the top bar but youd think i could at least get it midway up the stem without making the cables look uglyguess i should save for a wireless unit
k i have lots of knives very good expensive knives of all sizes and types most of which are shaving sharp since these were so cheap and im always looking for a good knife for backpacking and camping thought id give it a try i read all the reviews but honestly was pretty skeptical that these could really be that good as i said ive got plenty of great knives that are shaving sharp and then there is mora freaking scary sharp totally different category plus they use high quality steel and have great handle ergonomics just beware that the finger guard and choil is minimal and you definitely do not want your grip to slip forward with this knife so use with care
i love this product it tightly fastens the bikes and they are protected from scratching with the rubber rest and ties the only concern is light swaying it is slight and ive gotten used to it however it got me nervous at st since its my first ever hitchbike rack i ever used i recently drove hours or so and had absolutely no problems i plan to purchase a receiver lock and maybe a fastener to tighten the connection for my own piece of mind i also have an extremely difficult time removing the hitch pin likely due to inexperience and lack of hand strength
i will start by saying that every glock i own pregen and every glock i have carried as a police officer wears these grips rubber texture these really make your grip rock solid as one of my fellow officers said drop this gun its cuz you let go the rubber texture grips do not wear out far as i can tell and ive been using these for about years or so and they dont tear up your clothes i can not recommend these highly enough they are worth the price now you dont need these on a gen but any gen prior is a must
when i first received this holster i was outfitting an airsoft load out the pistol is secured to the pallet via velcro and it just can not keep the pistol completely vertical in the end the muzzle ends up pointing towards your leg i also have difficulty keeping this from sliding around on my belt and on my leg tightening the leg strap only partially helps the vertical strap up to the belt is velcro as well and can not be adjusted the rubber woven into the leg restraint is a nice touch but that piece of good engineering is overshadowed by the oversimplification of the belt loop
i cant say enough good things about this water filter of all of sawyers portable water filters all pointone family this one is by far the most useful and the most usedit comes with the reverse syringe to back wash the filter a small aluminum dirty water back and a rubber hosestrawthis thing is so unbelievably light its hard to believe it is a micro filter and it works fast it may not be as hands free as a gravity filter but its way less work than a water pump and water pumps have far great mechanical failure chances than this little guy heck i could carry two sets of these and still be lighter than just about every portable water filter ive seen and those other ones are micronsit fits on most cheap water bottles with the smaller bottle cap so you can recycle soda bottles or water bottles the aluminum bag is best though and sawyer sells a larger liter version that is super light and rolls up to be compact i bring two of the larger bags and one of the smaller bags the smaller bag i use during hiking the two larger ones i fill and cap at the camp site its dirty water of course so i just screw on the water filter when i want clean water and pour into a pot and boil microns is good for most things and certainly better than micron filtersbut its important to note that this is not a water purifier if there are toxic chemicals in the dirty water this will not filter them out it will filter out bacteria viruses etc so you should be able to just drink water collected from a stream or lake in the mountains just dont collect water from likely toxic areas like a large lake that has buildings and such generally i hike in the emigrant wilderness where there are no buildings by the lakes at feet and about in fact theres no one up there apart from park rangers and other backpackers so this type of filter is more than adequate up thereif you backpack in the wildernessi would recommend this over a pump without a doubt and frankly i think its better than a fravity filter becauseagainfewer points of failure and less weight to carry
these and all other magnesium fire starters are emergency equipment they are not suitable for everyday use to replace a lighter what you are paying for is shelf life and reliability not convenience matches and lighters work much better and faster but both of them can go bad over time and may not work at all when you really need them these bars last for decades even under water and they always work if you do your jobthe object is to shave off tiny thin shavings of metal until you accumulate enough to start your fire and then use the sparker to ignite the shavings this works extremely well but its a timeconsuming process that requires preparation and a stable low wind environment to work once you ignite it the magnesium burns really hot but not very long you have to be ready with kindlingi have carried these for years and used them only twice the ones i carry have been cut down lengthwise with a hacksaw to get rid of about of the magnesium the bar is much bigger than you need for emergenciesif you buy one of these start a few fires with it they take practicei highly recommend these fire starters they are a completely reliable long shelf life way to start a fire
honestly if i had read the reviews before ordering which i almost always do i probably would have passed and ordered something else maybe i got lucky but i have absolutely no issues here this went on a sig a which is a backup goto gun so i was looking for a good quality scope but didnt want to spend for an eotech which i have on my primaries no reticle level issues checked with a gauge to be sure no fuzzy reticle at any setting level either indoors or out tremendous light gathering capability holds zero after rounds of green tip and essentially can be mounted anywhere on the full length top rail i suspect there is a qc issue in manufacturing since people either get perfect units or have one of the issues mentioned above and in the reviews like i said maybe i got lucky but im extremely satisfied i dont care that it looks like my acogs i just care that it works in fact the matte finish is nicer than the semigloss black most other manufacturers use time will tell how well it holds up this will see a significant round count over the next few months so time will tell as to how well it holds up but ill write an update after k rounds wont cowitness well with sigs irons but aftermarket buis sights took some trial and error on models solved that problem was very close to zero right out of the box installation screw torque was set at inch same spec that my acogs call for and as i said its holding zero despite a few good knocks and a few hundred rounds so far extremely pleased very good value for the money
in my on again off again work out cycle im on again ive been at it long enough this time to have gotten to the point where doing shrugs had become a pain since i spent more time focusing on trying to hold onto the bar versus doing my reps i decided it was time to pick up a set of lifting strapsthese looked better than traditional straps and the reviews were good so i picked up a set im very pleased i did my sets this morning with no inkling of loosing my grip on the bar even when i increased the weight not only do they work well but they are very wellmade and surprisingly comfortable if you need a set of straps these are well worth the couple extra bucks
i bought this to inflate the ocean play center think x inflatable pool and this think made for quick work i didnt realize i was going to be inflating different compartments with three different size holes the adapters on the hose were invaluable i was going to use my workshop compressor but that just seems foolish now this thing is small and blows a lot of air fastand i never thought of using the pump to deflated anything but that option worked great tooi suggest leaving the tips attached to the hose as it comes in the box that way you dont lose any of them
ive been using this bag for short hiking and camping so far i have had no problems it is very durable and just the right size in my opinion it is big enough to hold a good bit of gear but also has several compression straps if you want it to be smaller its also has adjustable chest and waist straps for support the chest straps can be repositioned along the shoulder straps to accommodate different sized people there are multiple compartment and pouches which are covered in detail by the other reviews i am very satisfied with this product and will by more drago gear in the future
bought this tent to go hiking on the at in nc for the money i am not sure you can beat this tent i have not used it live action yet but setting up in the garage here are my opinions zippers and windows all zipped open and closed with no snags nice extensions of cloth to cover the bottom zipper edge from rain nice touch without the rainfly great airy tent with wonderful views if i can i would camp without it in good weather the rain fly seems very good really covers the rest of the tent and i get the impression this thing would shed water pretty nicely fit and finish seemed very good materials seem strong floor seems a little thinner than what i usually expect so i will definitely be using a floor protector underneath nice touches are the extra gear bags and the loft area in the top of the tent size of the tent seems good for two people roomy for one weight is excellent for backpacking regardless of the quality of the tent i recommend sealing it anyways
i suppose for those committed to using a breech end soft rod cleaning system this is probably a great kit this was the first time i tried using this type of rod for cleaning in my opinion there are times when you need to be able to push and pull a rod through the barrel and you cant with this yes you can remove it and pull it through from the other end but this can be difficult with some actions i then thought of using it as a rangefield use only kit but a hard rod is sometimes needed then as well for obstruction removal i also do not subscribe to the instructions of being able to use the same patch for passes through the barrel simply turn the patch and use a clean section what about fouling the pushes through the patch as it can and will do this just doesnt work for me it may be that i havent seen the way to use this but i think i will stick to using a solid rod with a guide to protect the barrel and action
t me start off by saying im not a fitness freak by any stretch of the imagination i do however try to stay healthy and was looking for an upperbody workout to complement my biking enter the perfect fitness multigym proassembly of the actual product is pretty straightforward just a few bolts and nuts i would recommend not using the included multitool though as a phillips screwdriver it doesnt really have the torque to tighten the bolts well and as a wrench it slipped off the nuts more than once in the time i assembled it roughly minutesthe multigym itself is very wellconstructed almost everything is metal with numerous foam grips and foam at any point where the thing would touch the wall to avoid scratches and scuffs getting it into and out of the doorway is a piece of cake and the crossbar is adjustable to the molding around your doorall that being said it would have been nice for the user manual to include what kind of exercises you can do on the multigym there was a nice section on warmups and stretches but for a novice like me the only way to tell what i should be doing is the pictures on the box and they arent exactly clear for example it appears you can use this for pushups by placing it on the floor but there are no grips where the man in the picture appears to be holding
i wish i could give this a star review i loved it while it lasted but after months and uses it sprung a leak i left it full on my nightstand laying on its side closed duh and by morning it leaked a considerable amount fl oz the hole is almost unnoticeable but when if i hold it over the sink upside down no squeezing it slowly drips out of one of the seams around the lid area when i put a little a pressure similar to pressure it would experience in a pack it drips pretty rapidly this bottle is awesome until it leaks i wish i could buy more but i cant trust it in my pack if it could spring a slow leak at any time and get stuff wet
so yes i too got mine in a semidestroyed box it had a second immediately internal box though that was in perfect shape so that was pretty cool i dont recall how the chains came i think they were already connected and ready to gothe one problem i had chainwise is the caribinerssp are a little too small im almost considering going out to a camping store and finding some heavyduty ones im sure weightwise theyre fine but theyre just too small its hard to explain but when you look at it youd know what im talking aboutalso i have a really nice heavy duty bag rack and i need to get somemore support weight on the bottom that lbs swinging around needs more than lbs holding it down for sure im probably going to double thati took out all of the extension chains which is really easy via like caribinerssp that are at all of the key points so we just switched a few around and viola shortened it by about inches which was perfect height for my bag racki read a lot of reviews saying the softness distribution is all out of whack the middle section is exactly the same softness as my lber maybe slightly more firm so i have nothing to judge that on but its just pefect for me the top section i would never hit because it jerks my rack around the lower section well lets just say thats for when your hands legs get a little tougher i punchkick there a few times a day to soften it up and to toughen myself up im sure itll be fine some dayoh yea bottom line you need to buy some serious serious gloves for this thing i suggest mid to high range gloves with some really good wrist wraps or your wrists are not going to be happy campersalso dont think like youre going to be punching on this thing for a half hour straight even with gloves on for a few weeks you need to be taking breaks like every min even if youre scaling up from a lower bag heat friction moisture not good for your knuckles since this thing is so heavy your knuckles are rubbing against it a lot more so yea take good breaks dont be like me try punching it for min kicking it for min or somethinganyway i hope this helps i think thats everything i really enjoy this bagtalk to yall later
if you have ever been in the woods and thought to yourself i only had some well paracord is even better than rope it holds lbs per length meaning lbs if you double it and it is cheap as dirt lighter than rope and if its black like this is then its easy to stay camod in the woods when youre toting on your favorite walking stick etci use it extensively for making hog snares you have to be a little tricky with the snare set up so they cant shew through it but if its used right its the best snare material available it also makes for a great way to string things up in the woods i hungstaked out my camo net hunting blind with it this year and its still hanging in my favorite spot
my wife purchased these directly from ironmaster in a package as an early fathers day present i have owned at one time or another most of the major equipment brands at one time or another and ironmaster is the best quality of anything i have ever used it removed the down time from changing weights now that i have used them several times i can swap anywhere from lbs in seconds i read one review about it being to use then the manufacturer made it which simply isnt accurate i personally found them easier to swap plates faster than the ironmaster website i can do circuit training almost as fast as switching from db to dbi also received the super bench with the hypercore dip attachment crunch attachment and the pullup bar which are all fantastic i can rip through my routine in about minutes less then i could beforehand using the traditional threaded dbthe rack is very sturdy it looks flimsy in the pictures but is very solid and has adjustable feet to keep it level with this setup i can do just about anything i wish and has vastly exceeded my expectations from a i love using them and have no worries or reservations about using them like i did with the bowflex or powerblocks
just finished watching open water and im really nauseatednot from gore or disgust but from being emotionally wrenched my husband and i dont have any kids and we have vacationed in the caribbean and we drive a white lexus suv so maybe i identified too closely with this couple they obviously loved each other and to me thats what made the movie so wrenching it was only too easy to put myself in their places it is a quiet movie in some ways yet nearly every shot and splash is laden with suspense i like it for the same reason i liked the blair witch project i was able to completely what was going on and feel empathy for the characters the wife even made the exact choice at the end that i would have made my husband refused to even watch it because he knew it would upset him now if youll excuse me im going to go have a good cry and work the tension knots out of my neck
i have to give this program five stars not because its perfect with no flaws but because im a scifi fan and really appreciate good science fiction this is good science fiction the entire cast and crew did some exceptional work work they can justifiably be proud of it is absolute disgrace that the scifi channel chose to shut them down before they had completed their story the producers said they got to finish their story sort of with the followup mini series farscape the peace keeper wars ive yet to view this program so i cant say how well they were allowed to tie up all the loose ends interviews with the cast indicated that the actors were pleased that they got to return and at least try to give their loyal fans a proper ending to the story i hope they were successful it seems to me as if a program is doomed from the start if it gives its audience an exceptionally good performance in writing acting directing and producing all these factors are necessary for good programming all theses factors are very expensive the networks would rather not be out that expense they have found out they can put out a brainless piece of fluff call it a reality show and still draw enough of an audience to make a profit that is truly sad if this trend continues im afraid producers will just quit trying to give us good programming and we will be left with nothing but fluff wake up tv audiences refuse to watch that fluff demand good programs
i remember trying to watch some of these pink panther movies back when i was a kid and really not getting the humor at all now all these years later firmly convinced of peter sellers comic genius after watching dr strangelove i thought that i would surely laugh heartily at inspector clouseaus antics its unfortunate that the first such film to cross my mediaconsuming path was this one the revenge of the pink panther sellers last true film of the series i have no doubt that the earlier films are certifiably funny but this one really just sort of sits there no energy few laughs and not much of a story sellers unique accent is funny but at times its about all this movie has going for itas usual somebody is out to kill chief inspector clouseau this time its a dirty businessman named douvier robert webber attempting to secure his somewhat weakened position in a french connection of heroin smuggling again as usual clouseau manages to survive the assassination attempt through a most bizarre thoroughly bumbling turn of events this time though the bad guys and everyone else think clouseau is dead and clouseau himself has a little trouble convincing anyone including his nutty sidekick cato thats hes the recently departed chief inspector thinking his hated nemesis is finally out of the picture former chief inspector dreyfus herbert lom leaves the sanitarium and returns to his old job taking charge of the investigation into clouseaus murder to his horror though he cant shove clouseau out of his mind because he keeps seeing him wherever he goes as for clouseau he goes to find the guys who tried to kill him with the help of douviers former mistress simone legree dyan cannon he follows the gang to hong kong intent on breaking the french connection case wide open hot on his trail is dreyfus who has finally become convinced that his sightings of clouseau were not his indicative of his madness reasserting itself with all parties finally together in the same place a seemingly unavoidable tiresome chase scene finally brings the activities to an endi would certainly not advise anyone to repeat my mistake of watching the revenge of the pink panther before seeing any of the first five films those earlier productions were undoubtedly much funnier than this rather tired denouement to sellers career as the bumbling detective if you werent particularly enthused about the earlier ones you undoubtedly wont walk away overly impressed by this one either some people just dont this type of slapstickoriented comedy and i may actually be one of those people im not going to judge the whole series based on this sixth film alone though as its generally regarded by fans as the least entertaining of the bunch not counting the films that followed sellers untimely death in of course
the adventure is acceptable enough but whats with the adultery theme this outing sees lois lane virtually married to another man nevertheless the man of steel whom i had thought above such things uses his xray vision to spy on her leer at her hold her take her for unsupervised romantic night flights etc would you still feel okay watching this if lois were your wife yeah something was not right about this this whole thing gave me an uncomfortable feeling because you got the idea that superman was wrongly trying to reclaim fields he had forsakenanother bummer was the script never really let kevin spacey take off like you know he could have
i did not like the show as much because brenda was not in it she was the one i liked the most i dont like valerie at all when this show was on tv and they did this season with out brenda everyone was like what the hell being her back to the show no one like it whatever this dvd is only good because there older and they get a club peach pit after dark but i missed brenda it was never the same but they talked about her some bad job to the people who took her out
kay i know this is a bmovie amp i know your expectations are not supposed to be high with a film like this especially since it is an early van damme flickbut come on there are other movies with martialarts themes that are wellmade amp reasonably accurate ever see quotjudo saga quot how about quotthe th chamber of shaolinmaster killerquot from the shaw brothers of hongkong how about the independent feature quotiron amp silkquot which probably cost the same amount to make as quotkickboxerquot but was much better made for that matter quotan officer amp a gentlemanquot a romance movie with richard gere amp debra winger has excellent martialarts in it with gere amp louis gosset jr going at it with karate but quotkickboxer quot theres not an ounce of heart or sincerity in it however it is is unintentionally funny at timeson the whole this movie is just awful its not just because van damme cant act its not just because he poses with shotokan techniques rather than engaging in legitimate choreography its because this movie supposedly about the sport of muay thai thailands national sport amp science of selfdefense is portrayed extremely innacurately michel quissi who plays the villain quottongpoquot behaves more like a wwf prowrestler than a muaythai boxer when real boxers in thailand meet each other in the ring they say prayers amp exchange gifts before fighting each other yes there is lots of gambling by the spectators but respect amp honor is utmost between muaythai boxers in this movie however they brutalize amp insult each other before during amp after the matches thai boxers tend to be very down to earth amp goodnatured young men who fight because its their job amp for some its the only way for them to put food on the table its also a source of selfrespect amp honor amp because of the nature of the sport many of them retire by the time theyre in their midtwenties ive had the honor amp priveledge to meet some of them amp they are nothing like whats portrayed in quotkickboxerquot i wont even get into the quotthaiquot names for the characters in this flick the writers obviously dont know the difference between chinese amp thais since all the quotthaisquot have chinese names its like portraying a spaniard with a german family name okay this is lowbudget hollywood filmmaking at its basest amp theyre not doing a serious documentary on the martialarts or muay thai in particular but the best of these films have at least the feeling of truth with maybe a little bit of exaggeration for entertainments sake this movie however goes way beyond quotexaggerationquot it actually disgraces what many consider to be the king of martialarts rent the quotkarate kidquot instead of this mess that movie has a few flaws too but at least the filmmakers for that movie cared about the subject matter which is a lot more than can be said for the people behind quotkickboxerquot
since farscape ended i have searched for something scifi to peak my interest and eureka seems to fit the bill it deals with the unknown of science fiction however it has great character developement that i long to see in shows i have called eureka because of its unusual quirkiness and character interaction they deal with loss of life innocence childhood jobs home and love the people of eureka all seem to have their strength and weaknesses with a little sinister developements underneatheureka is not the best scifi you will see however not since farscape have i been able to watch and hour of good scifi and feel the gamit of emotions and have a tear or more in my eyes at the end i am so glad season two was brought to being by the sci fi channel and this second season has not dissapointed be careful watching this season one of eureka because you may get hooked like i did
hi im camille bajema reporting for kids first and today im reviewing the film based on the book seal called which is based on a true story i like this film because im an animal lover and this film is filled with is about a little girl toni whitney played by tina majorina who lives with her parents harry and thalice played by shane meier and chelsea field her sister paula played by aidan pendleton and her brother steve played by keith carradine they have an assortment of animals and decide to adopt an orphaned baby seal that that they name andre andre lives with the whitneys for a few years until a man from the health department shows up and wants to take andre away my favorite character in this film is tonis mother thalice i like thalice because she is very loving toward her kids yet also knows how to discipline themmy favorite scene in this movie is when andre learns funny tricks and performs them for people on the pier i like this scene because andre is so cute and funn an interesting fact is that andre is played by a sea lion not a seal in the is directed by george miller and produced by annette handley the music in this film sets the mood the movie is filmed in a beautiful harbor in rockport maine and i especially love the cinematography when the seasons changethis movie is a tearjerker and toni learns that despite how much she loves andre she may have to let him go this is a familyfriendly movie and i recommend it to people of all ages i give this film fiveoutoffive stars because i thought that the movie was really welldone overall and had a great plot i am pleasantly surprised that i enjoyed this movie so much because the picture on the cover made me think that it would appeal to a younger audience
this film was on the here cable channel and like man and the other donald strachey mysteries this features a gay hero in the lead i purchased this one mainly because of that leading man robert gant but was happy to see that the film stands on its own merits the lead character jacob keane played by gant is an ex spy who is pulled back into action the movie contains great action sequences and gant is up to the challenge to play a hero that is like a combination of james bond and jason bourne but still has his own personility and even a boyfriend though not a big fan of shannon doherty i was quite surprised by her performance here and the chemistry that she and gant has not romantically but as partners was great great acting good action and a good story that hopefully will lead to future franchise such as the donald strachey films
by the end of this film youll love this guy kenny appears to be a bit rough around the edges but he is a funny person that leads a unique lifestyle installing portaloos the humor is mostly toilet related humor but its understated and mostly revolves around the way people stereotype him and the strange situations that his job gets him into saving the portaloos from nascar fansthe interviews with kenny are very candid and his support cast are great i especially liked kennys relationship with his family and how they give him so much strife about having a real and he just takes it it certainly makes his romance with the flight attendant who accepts him for who he is more genuine overall this is an uplifting one to see
this drama about the denizens of canadian theatre company in the town of burbage is excellent from season one episode one right through to the final season three episode six i point this out because so many tv series lose steam as they progress from episode to episode and season to season not slings and arrowsit cleverly inserts welldone scenes from shakespeare in a most entertaining manner hamlet was the play being produced during season one and amazingly from watching slings and arrows i learned much about the text of hamlet so much so that after watching season one i had to go back and watch hamlet againit is a series in which you will care about the characters you will like some of the characters and be ready to strangle others dont get the idea that slings and arrows is pedantic its dramatic quirky and fun to watchi took the time to write this review simply because there dont seem to be a lot of reviews and i hope that more reviews will result in more people discovering and enjoying this great series
my rating is for the extended directors cut film i will only address the bluray issue i have a fantastic audio system composed of high end b and w speakers pioneer elite receiver with high end hdmi connected to p projection system with ft screen the bluray machine definitely upgrades the image from the regular directors cuti do not see the difference with the bluray disk so the extra expense is not warranted at least if you will be viewing through a projection system i am sure you will see it on a large plasma tvi was dismayed to hear that there are hobbit movies coming out between appears to be greed here with so many versions theater cuts directors cuts and then bluray theatrical and finally bluray directorss extended this causes unnecessary over purchase of the movie so i am going to wait for the final bluray directors cut of the habbit in or later and not be suckered into buying multiple versionsthis was a shame and totally greed on the studios partno matter whatthis is the best movie of all time
kay chances are that unless you eat breath and sleep animation and movies you didnt see iron giant in the theater in fact theres a good possibility that youve never even heard of it before now i am here to tell you that it is a crying shame if you have not had the privelage of watching this wonderful imaginative work of cinema its a warm wellpresented tale of a boy and his robot and the power of friendship easily one of the five best animated films in the last years iron giant is a modern fairy tale that will delight and entrance everyone from age to dont fear buyers regret this is a surefire hit
i want to see more of the new super mario bros or super mario world i am not as addicted to the mario bros as i am with the teenage mutant ninja turtles i love the turtles i grew up watching the original series i will collect all the episodes regardless of how much money i do spend hey its worth spending money on something that really interests you how do i feel about the new teenage mutant ninja turtles and the movie well it is not as intense entertaining and emotional as the original one and the following three movies in which the turtles were real they were not d animated like tmnt the original is always better than something that duplicates it todays music and tv shows are crappy senseless and a waste of someones time
k this rating would be stars if it were the disc version disney unfortunately lately has been not only abandoning its marketing division but has been abandoning its d animation program lately and unfortunately this has affected such great dvds as this one while lilo and stitch is enjoyable and one of disneys more successful detatchments from their story norms the lack of more special extras on the dvd simply could add more to it recently however the demand for a disc special collectors edition of lilo and stitch has been announced and will be released within the next year i personally am going to wait until this comes out and purchase it in hopes that this will encourage disney to put out more special editions like its tarzan collectors edition its beauty and the beast collectors edition and its atlantis collectors edition as it will show disney that people in the audience are not soley interested in the movie but also have some interest in the process of film making
um is it just me or was anybody else thinking resident evil the entire time they watched the movie obviously the question only applies to people who have played resident evil but seriously the african background zombies attacking people in broad daylight i couldnt help but actually want to play a game ive been sick of for years after watching this movieas for the movie itself it was a throw back to the slow shuffling zombies and well executed overallhowever it was not an actionhorrorgorysexual type movie and it was barely a character driven type of moviefor the most part all i knew is this guy survives a plane crash and at some point hooks with an african dude soldier and they try to go somewhere presumably to escape the dark continentoh yeah and to find the soldiers son who ran off with a bunch of survivorsit was not the most engaging movie ive ever seen but the change of scenery which i found effective coupled with the fact that the acting wasnt quite as terrible as ive seen in any number of zombie movies makes it a three star affairpsas a die hard zombie fan you could probably live without this as it is unfortunatley not all that distinctivejust the setting really from other low budget zombie movies and you wouldnt be missing out on any gory kills as there were none
it is always a treat to find movies like this one when it first came out i happened to rent it because i like tommy lee jones and brian denehy i certainly wasnt disappointed they are both fine actors in fact if you havent seen everything they have made you have probably missed some of their other gems that are not well known like this one martha plimpton does an excellent job as jones daughter any fans of movies like river and hearts cant be should enjoy it little touches like trotline fishing barges hauling freight and the realism of the river towns make it stand outjones reunites with his daughter after many years absence in prison he takes her on a river trip down the muddy mississippi and more than the river is murky his past plays a pivotal part in deciding their future a cunning killer wants something that he has and will do anything to get it they must rely on their wits to escape certain death it becomes obvious they will be tracked no matter where they go and must find a way to stop the killer once and for allthis story is strong in many ways the loving relation between father and daughter and the passion of a murderer make it a winner the setting on the mississippi river adds a bit of mark twains tom sawyer and huck finn that we love the directing by thomas rickman is very impressive the acting sets and scenery are great too music by mike post alabama and the other bands are a nice touch as well i was born in illinois and lived a fair portion of my life in alton illinois near the river this movie does an excellent recreation of life on the river i highly recommend this movie i bought this on vhs since i cant get it on dvd just because it is well worth owning my whole family loves this movie
ikeepicmeetscars the odd kid out theo a snail has grand ambitions car racing kind of predictable a miracle transformation vast odds within inches of failure stunning success acceptance back home once hes proven himself plus a similar tale of redemption for his business partner if you think this is a spoiler you need to see more moviesok youve seen it before but your kid hasnt fun characracters quality animation excitement without being too scary but you know your little one best and pretty tolerable for the grownup buying the tickets three stars for you five for the kid im giving it four wiredweird
i just got done watching this evening hmmmm not sure what to make of it ive read and seen which i loved by the way of the reading many negative reviews for both the book and movie versions of i wasnt sure if i wanted anything to do with the book or the movie however decided to watch the movie for myself and form my own opinionhonestly i dont think is as bad as everyone has made it out to be it is suppose to be a prequel giving us the idea of why hannibal is the way he is as an adult i thought was suspenseful and well acted by the cast members we see hannibal as a monster out for revenge for those who killed his younger sister this is where hannibal begins to learn and refine his murderous appetite that we later refined when he becomes an adult what starts out as revenge turns into gruesome psychopathic behavior
i liked trigun i really did yet after a certain point i thought this series turned into a formulaic series where the guns just got bigger and the enemies more ruthless as it progressedit starts out pretty funny vash makes a great comedian he playfully dances as he dodges bullets and at one point hes even dancing to a walkman he steals donuts from millie and while hes running away from bad guys he also loves twisting his middle finger around his index finger to make a peace sign saying that he fights for and the story took an unexpectedly dark turn the villains became more vengeful and violent forcing vash to use more extra guns although he doesnt show his ultimate weapon in this box set its ridiculously powerfulthe series was just too excessively dramatic i didnt like how violent the series turned out at one point so many characters died and i wondered just how they were going to change the tone of the series it changed but i cant help but think that there was just way too much violence for me to fully recommend it its like a shortened version of dragonball zif you like hilarious humor just get the first box set if you like it enough buy the second if you like it thats great but i just cant recommend such a excessively violent series id rather watch from iwo
i hope the book was better because this movie had an unbelievably terrible script terrible acting even from scott bakula ive rarely heard lines delivered so badly from an ensemble but not only are the lines ridiculously bad theyre spoken badly too by almost every character and not much of a mystery makes me believe the book was written by a yearold unless the teleplay was just butchered the pacing was too slow the characters were ridiculous the main character can not seem to focus on getting out of a alive what an idiot her love interest goodnight follows a ridiculously puerile fairy tale arc and so on ghastly

is this a great movie probably not is it unique diverting and able to pack a wallop absolutely just seeing christoph waltz get his due at the end is worth watching the whole thing waltz ventures constantly toward over the top that constantly had me wondering was he really that bad an actor following bad direction or what hes downright irritating every moment on film and his scene in the paris cafe where he is talking and eating at the same time is classic irritation one frankly wants to knock his block off he was playing a nazi the ultimate nazi so some disgust is expected however i chanced to see him in an entirely different movie water for elephants and damned if he wasnt just as irritating in that his performances are transparent and shallow there is nothing likable about him at all this man should never eat and talk at the same time
i am going to repeat the title of this review i dont care what anyone says i love the american pie movies not the crappy straight to dvd portions of it but american wedding and this little gem despite the grossout gags and gratuitous nudity the american pie franchise is actually quite sweet and a very conservative heart beats underneath good films versus great ones usually work out that way you think its about one thing and it surprises you with depth when i first saw american pie i didnt want to go thinking it would just be another vapid teenage sex comedy i was dragged kicking and screaming i wanted to see the haunting and it turned out to be a gem the other films have continued this funny but deep trend if you can handle it i would suggest this film
side from the disturbing subject matter a mighty heart was done very well they handled the tragedy of daniel pearls murder in a nonexploitative manner you sort of have to be a person or in some way be fascinated with the genre to really be entertained by this film a mighty heart not only focuses on the timeline story of what happened but also includes alot of intoxicating viniettes of the city street life in pakistan it gives you a glimpse inside a world many of us will never get to see i think a mighty heart is one of angelina jolies best films and most captivating performances her only other notable good films are gia and sky captain and the world of tomorrow for the slew of films about the and iraq war genres a mighty heart and united are about the best you will see concerning the issue
i am late to this series my mother praised it so much that i had to watch it to see if was as good as she said its better smart screenwriting excellent actors are just of the reasons justified has gone on to now in its th season one thing i noticed right away about justified was the writing wasnt the usual hollywood predictable ending type that is the norm for tv shows you really cant predict how a episode of justified will end very refreshing in the wasteland of primetime tv i love watching it on amazon prime fantastic that it is free with membership up to the end of season now ill have to get the tv pass for seasons and
it took a second viewing for me to finally understand and completely fall under the magic spell the fountain leaves on its audience like most people i was confused but this film possesses an aspect most can not comprehend at first which is why i recommend watching it once or twice again before throwing judgementinstead of presenting a straightforward plot beginning middle end the fountain uses an intellectual but confusing story focused on two loveentwined people throughout time the acting is superb and extremely moving and the blazing nebula finale is sure to be written down in the books for being one of the most beautiful film creations to date the music composed by clint mansell adds to the magic of the fountain especially at the end in which tommy from the future finally reaches the rebirthing nebula somewhere far in the galaxy and is reborn with his love izzy represented here in the form of a dying tree i know it sounds bogus but watch the movie this startlingly lovely scene combined with the music will bring anyone with a soul to tears sure the fountain might not be the favorite for everyone but as far as fantasy films go it definitely holds its ground
i wasnt going to review this movie because i got it from netflix and watched it the other night but after reading some of the completely nonsensical star reviews i had to post something while i rated it stars it truly would have been but i wanted to try to counteract all the star reviewsthis is the adaptation of maurice sendaks classic picture book it is the story of max a year old boy from a broken home who is losing his relationship with his sister and is seeing his single mother move on socially he feels slightly neglected and a childs natural reaction is to act out in a negative way he runs away and finds a boat and then sails to the wild things this film does is changes the into a metaphor for maxs psyche notice how each of the wild things is a representation of emotion or mentallity carol is angry and aggressive doug is intelligent judith is insecure etc they all look to kw for balance because she is the emotional center the voice of reason if you will she comes and goes when things are calm and positive she is there when things are out of control and crazy she disappearswhat director spike jonze does in this film is perfectly displays the inner turmoil in a childs mind especially a child who isnt satisfied with his home life ultimately he does grow as a character and a person and goes home to his familythis movie is an incredibly intelligent movie which is rich in symbolism and depth after reading over half i admit i didnt read all pages of the star reviews a couple things became apparent number one was that a majority of the negative reviews were simply because they didnt understand the movie that is understandable as it is a very thoughtful movie the second thing was people were upset that they couldnt just plop their children in front of the tv for minutes and have that time to themselves to put it bluntly they wanted this movie to be a babysitteri do agree that some and actually most children most likely would not like this movie because they wont really understand it that alone doesnt make this a bad movie the film is destined to be one of the most polarizing movies of all time as well as one of the most misunderstood i highly recommend watching it only if you have an open mind and are ready to be intellectually stimulated
chop shop is an incredibly well done film that manages to be vivid gritty and moving all at once as it paints a portrait of two young people a young latino lad named ale and his older teenage sister isamar the film clearly has a documentary flavor to it and the handheld camera footage works wonders for this film indeed alejandro polanco and isamar gonzalez perform so well youd swear they simply werent acting and that this was a look at the lives of real two people pure and simple the action move along at a fine pace you really get to know ale isamar and the people in their lives and the filmmakers never once rush things nor do they let things drag on and i like that a lot the script and casting were very well done alejandro polanco had no prior acting experience but wow how he gives a convincing performance he is destined to become a bright star if thats what he wants to do with his life isamar gonzalez turns out an equally brilliant performancewhen the action begins we quickly meet ale an orphaned young lad of perhaps eleven or twelve ale works like a dog in a chop shop in a part of queens new york city where crime and poverty are facts of life he knows how to remove parts from cars and how to add parts to cars and his boss is teaching him how to prime and part cars as well ale certainly doesnt have the best relationship with his boss ale wants to count his payday money as soon as his boss gives it to him which makes the boss angry to say the least at this point ales older teenage sister isamar comes to live with him in a small makeshift apartment above the chop shop as ale essentially takes the lead in terms of trying to care for himself and isamar he is stunned and very upset when he discovers how isamar makes extra money in addition to her day job but he internalizes his angst and frustration never once confronting her in addition ale and isamar are saving up money as fast as they can to buy an old truck from which they can sell food and become their own bossesunfortunately life being what it is not everything goes well for ale and isamar some events are heartbreaking while others are full of feeling including the brief scene in which a man shows ale how to feed the pigeons and make with them its also interesting to note that while ale and isamar are presumably orphans there isnt even a single reference to their parentsor any other family members at allthe dvd comes with an optional running commentary and there is another featurette simply entitled shop is a delight for fans of director ramin bahrani and people everywhere who enjoy very high quality independent dramas with unknown actors performing brilliantly
im a black american but when i was at or years old my wonderful father told me that his grandmother on his fathers side was halfcherokee indian after doing some reading and research on american indians i have become more proud of my cherokee indian heritage than my so called african heritagedue to the fact indians have suffered the worst oppression in our country and for a black man to embrace or find his ancestry other than african is still considered wrong in the black community even by the dvds admittance it is the black community as a whole frowns on those blacks who embrace their mixed blood ancestry i for one am proud of all my ancestry which cherokee indian and black on my fathers side and white asian indian and black on my mothers side i dont buy this one drop black blood rule and i personally would like to thank the creators of this dvd as well as tiger woods for standing up against the status quo in the black community i am planning on to find my cherokee heritage with my father when i go home on leave and hope to my great grandmothers kin among the cherokee nation
well time humor great character personalities and a well written script and great directing drive this movie to become one of the best animated films ever made this movie plays a parody on all superheros where two superheros meet and fall in love and start a family of superheros but before that happens all superheros are band from public view forever due to liabilities then a badguy comes into play after several years of our superhero family being in hiding out for revenge against our superhero dad for rejecting him as a sidekick years earlier the superhero dad then is trapped and our superhero family comes to the rescue in the end everything is right again and our superheros are once again the heros of the day
maldonado miracle thethis is a lovely film that i looked for for years after seeing it on british tv it gently takes a swipe at human understanding or lack of chiding us also for wanting to be selfimportant whilst losing sight of what is really important in life but then reminds us that if we stop looking for somebody to come in and make a grand gesture of change in our lives we can see the small miracles that already have power in our lives there are some truly fine performances here especially in the on screen relationship between mare winningham and ruben blades peter fondas work here is every bit as crafted and lean as his earlier work in heart is deceitful above all eddy martin is a gem of a find as the young mexican boy at the centre of events salma hayek as a debuting director is to be commended
fter some years since i first and last saw this pictures a couple of months ago on a trip i was invited to see the play based on this movie then about an hour after seeing it i turn on the tv and hear that polanski who i hadnt heard about in years has just been arrested in switzerland hey these were signs i had to buy this dvd which by they way certainly doesnt dissapoint i found it truly funny creepy and scary the scene where alfred runs away in the court from the afemminated vampire is a true classicfunny how the first half of the movie is practicaly silent while the play is full of dialogue and jokes but my biggest amazement was that even though well aware of the surprise ending it still felt quiet shockingand by the way the very day i get this dvd from amazon i read polanski has been let go on bailenough coincidences
this is a really fun set the movies are all fairly cheesy retro and all about blood thirsty nature gone wrong i was disappointed at the packaging having disks in case and not individual retail per movie packaging as my other shriek show sets are i was also disappointed with day of the animals only having been remastered in the tv version and not the theatrical version but aside from those two nitpicks its definitely one of the better shriek show sets day of the animals and grizzly both kind of look like made for tv movies from the s with the exception of grizzly having occasional gory but super quick like second shots of the bears victims i defiantly felt some late s nostalgia watching these two the uniforms and era of grizzly reminded me a lot of the old tv show chips day of the animals has leslie nilson in a very dramatic and crazy roll and is really entertaining the kills in both movies are quite funny with the bear decapitating people with one swipe and birds picking people up and carrying them away and the like the biggest surprise for me with this set was devil dog which turned out to be my favorite movie of the three this dog is impregnated by satan or something and the resulting offspring are demon dogs that have brain washing and mind control power over humans the evil creators of the pups place one of them with this american to wreck havoc on their lives and do the dogs bidding this is movie is nuts i loved it im sure theres tons of bonuses and extra features in this set with the addition of the bonus disks but im just in it for the flicks and all three of these are entertaining and fun
if you can get past the fact that there are two relatively big names ie antonio banderas and lucy liu and ignore the plethora of guns and explosions what you really get is an incredibly weak plot with more contrived scenes than i could count its essentially a movie as ridiculous as its title which just happens to be the reason why i avoided this garbage for nearly a decadeecks banderas is a semiretired fbi agent picked up by some kind of shadow government that also happens to be dia linked to canadian officials sort of who kidnap female chinese orphans insert lucy liu to create special agent assassins or something thrown into the mix is a woman married to two men a child being held for personal ransom and some imaginary top secret microscopic computer hardware that can induce heart attacks or embolisms when there is no empathy for a woman whose child has been abducted you know the movie is complete chaos speaking of thatthe director of this trainwreck is named kaos a pseudonym presumably used because he feels guilty that the plot and direction of this film resembles the consistency of diarrhea this movie is laughably bad way too little back story far too few details for character development there simply isnt anything developed and when explanations are given they are delivered through slowmo camera shots and three word sentencesaside from a couple explosions which are completely contrived and unconvincing there is nearly nothing redeemable about this movie even the soundtrack is an irritating distraction watch it if you feel like quoting the lines before the characters predicting the outcome thirty minutes early and yawning during the final showdownjason elin
nd now for something completely different the low budget film a comingofage movie about a sixteen year old girl from twickenham a london suburb in carey mulligan stars as jenny an endearing sweet pretty whipsmart articulate high school student who thinks she wants to go to oxford and get a degree jobs available to women were secretarial teaching nursing and being a housewife the movie is set just before the beatles and the mods would turn british society and the world on its ear jenny is part girl part woman right on the edge jenny sees what those around her miss she is bored with school bored with boys and impatient for her life to start she meets an older man with friends living in the fast lane and starts to question the need for a college education her father agrees for a girl in the early sixties going to college is only so she can catch a husband the big dangers is becoming before marriage jenny decides to cut some cornersthis touching movie is set in the same period as and shares many of its attitudes set design styles clothes music and attitudes are like in extremely detailed and period accurate this movie so accurately captures the period it could have been shot in the mid sixties and put in a time capsule we reviewers can not really judge the past from the attitudes of today this is really how people thought and acted and the attiudes of the english in the early sixties were not that far removed from the attitudes in america highly recommended and carey mulligan is luminous in the lead part
it seems as if all of the tribal fusion dvds have different things that are good about them you dont really know what youre going to get until you buy it this one is the shoulder shimmies i havent seen another video that shows how much attitude you can create just with those two humps on either side of your neck she also shows you snake arms very well you see a front and back view at the same time which helps show you jsut which muscles on your back should be moving her stretch routine includes the splits which i cant do so i was just standing around for that part it also seems as if locking the movements into place was easier in watching this dvd she makes the movement before the lock obvious so you can see what your muscles should be doing
ive recently asked people from the religion and christianity forum here on amazon what were their views on horror movies ive always been curious to know what they think about demons angels and demonic possessions and the way they are depicted in horror movies at first i thought that stupidity nonsense and heresy would be the main comments i would get in regards to horror but i was far from the truth a few people indeed admitted that horror was nothing more than nonsense for them but a majority of them actually liked the genre and the movies for what it is we had an interesting discussion about it and i was surprised to see that yes some of those movies were indeed able to bring a little message of faith across people who never really had a opinion on it but mostly those movies were also seen and praised for entertainment purposes basically just to have a good time like everybody else stigmata was one of those movies it was raw scary entertaining and at the same time carrying a very strong message of faithstigmata was not a big hollywood production movie i never consider it like that it was simple and straight to the point no big hollywood stars no crazy special effect just a good story with punch i would consider it as so as any movies involving demonic possessions and exorcisms it is the story of frankie paige a young atheist who seemed to have received what is consider as marks and sores corresponding to the crucifixion wounds of jesus christ father andrew kiernan will help frankie figure this out and find out why these things are happening to her it appears frankie might be holding the key to what would appear to be a gospel in the exact words of jesus christ the gospel of thomas father kiernan will have to get to the bottom of this eluding a conspiracy to keep this gospel from coming outdefinitely recommend it to any religious horror fans a good movie with a strong message and remember jesus said the kingdom of god is inside you and all around you not in mansions of wood and stone split a piece of wood and i am there lift a stone and you will find meenjoy
its midafternoon when a woman mary astor walks into the detective agency of sam spade humphrey bogart and miles archer jerome cowan with a tale of a wayward sister she wants them to track down this sister has taken up with a no good named thursby archer agrees to do the stake out and hopefully follow thursby to the sisterin the middle of the night spade is wakened by a phone call archer has been shot a little later thursby is also shot the police seem intent on pinning one of those crimes if not both on spade meanwhile the client has disappeared and a man peter lorre holds spade a gun point demanding the maltese falcon what in the world is going on after i listened to this book on tape i fully intended to watch the classic movie version it only took my three and a half years as such my recollection of the book might be a little dim but this movie version didnt deviate too wildly from what i remember in fact it improved by tightening up several scenes near the climax that dragged in the book the story is still compelling and the characters seriously flawed yes the plot is now a cliche in many ways but this story did it firstmy only real complaint with the movie is the dated acting the characters speak too fast most of the time not giving us time to process or emotions time to be fully explored of course that would be a blessing for mary astor who over acts all her emotional scenes and shes got plenty of them the style of acting here would work well for the stage or a silent movie but its caught up in the transition to talking movies stilleven so this movie is well worth watching it is definitely a classic for a reason
first lets establish that i dont think quotgiantquot is a classic by any definition too long indifferent acting too much fluff that said i guess i remember it as a spectacle worthy of the total sprucing up it needed to bring it to dvd tiomkins rousing score in digital sound punching up of the very faded vhs tapes film quality and some nice extras maybe out of isnt bad except in this case the extras are the only plus otherwise the movie seems to have been transferred directly from vhs to dvd the sound over the opening titles was so tinny and distorted that i double checked my sound settings to make sure my equipment wasnt out of wack nope just plain lousy monophonic clamor the color is so washed out in many places that i started to think maybe i had been sent a preproduction copy before sound and color had been worked on but i see several other reviewers had the same reactionshame on warner bros for putting out a major movie of such abominable quality the extras are terrific but i know very few film fans who buy movies based on the extras take it off the market and do it right warners
this is the first great movie i see after so many years finally a quality product with most of the new movies lately i was thinking did it really worth my time or money not with this one it is perfect all around the actors couldnt be better and the plot is moderndays intelligent i appreciated the storys smart development and amazing attention to details all made me feel what i saw was real it is one of those movies that i would like to collect rewatch lend to friends the most close in comparable quality action movie is enemy of the state with will smith
ill start off by saying i am actually a disney fan liked their old classic animation and am a big fan of their mermaid aladdin lion era also like suspending my skepticism and scorn for all the negative disney reality and taking someone who has never been to their theme park before especially children and seeing their eyes grow to the size of pie pansthat said this tinker bell movie does not have the draw or magic of a classic disney reconversion of a fairy tale or even one of the more modern fairy tales or original pixar stories of recent yearsid have trouble showing this to any young male children and can only picture a very young girl who really like the character of tinker bell as being interested in watching the film it is just one of those dvds you would rent and have your kids watch once and be thankful you did not buy it since it would sit on the shelf and never be watched more than once
the one who hasnt seen the matrix well do yourself a favor and buy one of the best science fiction films of all time this is a definite buy recommendation its one of my favorite filmsi saw this the first time in a sparsely occupied theatre and it really was a random pick at the dollar show because i hadnt heard anything about it during its first release at the larger theatres when the film was over i was in awe it was probably the coolest things i had ever seen on screen i was blown away how many films in your lifetime even do that to you to try to explain the story would be too difficult and confusing here let me just say that its set in the future and machines and software are ruling the earth now what does that tell you not much huh even to the people in the matrix they had to experience it to get an understanding of it and even thenkeannu reeves is perfect for this role his cool attitude really fits the character hugo weaving is great as agent smith really the whole cast is goodthe cinematography colors costumes sets and special effects are great and theres loads of special effects some of which have been copied ad nauseum since its release its fastpaced engrossing and intellectual thats pretty rareit was directed by the wachowski brothers they also directed bound another underrated film although the transition to the matrix was pretty phenomenal i cant imagine how theyll top this with the sequel a major reason why this was so awesome was that it was so originalgranted seeing it on the big screen and seeing it on your tv is a big difference but nowhere near worth downgrading it its still an awesome and the dvd is loaded with interesting extras buy it
having seen the original i looked forward to seeing this remake the original had a quasidocumentary feel to it with its grainy footage and cast of virtual unknowns the film was a visual cornucopia of terror and horror though there was actually very little gore shown on screen the unusually macabre sets and the relentless sound of the chainsaw bandied by leatherface were enough to make the viewer tremblethis remake has stuck relatively close to the original in terms of a general story line though there are of course some differences in the remake a group of teens set off in their van on their way to a concert in texas where they end up in a rural area after picking up a dazed female hitchhiker their world is turned upside down when she does the unspeakablethey go looking for help and unfortunately come across a house inhabited by one heck of a family of crazies from the moment they do so the teens run hither and dither as they are chased by a chainsaw wielding leather faced maniac unlike the original this film is a real slasher type horror film with plenty of blood and gore this is the real difference between the original and the remakewhile the remake has much better production values than the original as well as better acting by its cast the original was far scarier the director of the original tobe hooper did far more with far less still if you are a fan of bloody slasher films this is worth a rental better yet rent both the original version as well as this remake and then judge for yourself as to which is the superior horror flick
the blair witch project is a reminder that indepentant film is far superior to main stream film this is a film with no scripts not real actors and no cheap props three college students are lost in the woods shooting a documentary about the blair witch everything that we can see comes from the lense of their two cameras we never see anything exept that and that is the beauty of the film it simplicity this is a film that works so well and can never be duplicated successfully the best part of this film is that the reactions the actors display are real this film is impovisation like i said no scripts the actors are really in the woods and are being terrorized by the director and his crew the dvd features are excellent the commentary is excellent as is the documentary that is included this is an excellent film that sadly you will either like or hate i have never heard of anyone who has a median position about this movie and this is mainly due to the ending good luck and sweet dreams
this movie is heart moving and teaches a valuble lesson about humanity and the world in which we live for me growing up in the seventies was a time for for reflection and finding your direction in life whats my purpose the message the meaning from this movie still to this day seems even more relevant the movie is about a very wealthy young manbud cort who feels he has no purpose in life and is consumed with the thought of death which we all must face sooner or later his mother is very insensitive to his feelings and only cares about material things in life and making sure her son gets to the aristocratic level which she belongs too he meets this elderly woman ruth gordonseveral times at different funeralshe likes to go to funeralsand the movie takes off from their with a lot of comedy relief and the beginning of the learning process for this young man the valuable knowledge gained from this movie for me when i was is a lesson that should be learned by all of us searching for a purpose in life we also should not take things in life so seriously as with everything in life all will pass and we will die mauderuth gordonteaches him the value of life the beauty of it all despite her terrible secret she was a survivor of the holocaust so live life be good and love this is a movie that should be watched by all people young or old who feel a little empty about themselves and need some insight everyone could learn something from this incredible heart moving classic
with last years fast and the furious and now xxx director rob cohen and his team have come up with a new kind of movie franchise take some bad acting sophmoric dialouge surround them with a heavy metal soundtrack a lot of special effects and tired stunts and hope for the bestvin diesel was fine in supporting roles in quotboiler roomquot and quotsaving private ryanquot but he aint no james bond and as an action superstar in quotxxxquot he displays as much charisma as yesterdays bed of lettuceeven the great samuel j jackson is crippled by the deadly screenplayyou can almost hear him saying to himself quotlet me get my check and get the hell out of herequotthe dvd is loaded with special features but when a movie is this bad its kind of like puttting a lexus hood ornament on a dodge dart
s with the first black stallion movie i probably would have liked this one better if i hadnt read the book first there are lots of things that are changed for example the setting for the blacks home is changed to north africa instead of saudi arabia and alec ends up going off on the journey by himself instead of with henry and mr volence the owner of one of the horses who ran against alec in the match race but these are changes i can handle the one thing that really irks me is the way abu ishak was portrayed in the book abu ishak was a pretty nice guy he offered alec a reward when he came to claim the black legally and tactfully and understood how much alec loved the black when alec and his travelling companions find abu ishaks home abu ishak warmly welcomes them in the film however the same character is a total jerk he ruthlessly snatches the black away after setting the ramsays barn on fire to create a diversion and even ties alec up at the pier to stop him from following them and when alec treks all the way across the desert to find him abu ishak only allows alec to stay after alec coerces him into it by appealing to his conscience only at the end at the film does he show something resembling kindness the ending in the film was ok but i like the books ending better when ishak promises alec the blacks first colt i suppose the directors wanted to make sure there wouldnt be another sequel cassoles presence was about the only thing that made this film very appealing i give it two stars
this was a very interesting movie set in the s but you forget that as two people try to survive the wilderness i enjoyed this very much despite the idiotic things they had the male lead do in this film but then i remembered that men had a different place in society in the s and not much faith in women sometimes the growing bond between the two lead characters is touching and refreshingly non sexual this was based on a true story and was more focused on survival rather than romance as might be seen in a work of fiction highly recommend this film as acting by the young eskimo woman was very good with some glances how once again eskimos were treated by the government in theyukon territory
teran in this hard job robert duvall incarnates the wisdom experience and a young man sean penn will be training in this underworld through the hidden face of lathough the script suffers a little bit of fallling in common places the formule engages the viewer duvall and the excellent camera work of dennis hopper maria conchita alonso makes an interesting performance in a little role penn as always splendid but duvall stole the show in certain way he holds the sixty per cent of the filmto my mind this is the second major work of dennis hopper after easy rider
its great to have this disc complete first season compilation on dvd although no one will confuse charlies angels with quotqualityquot television this show was never meant to be taken seriously this campy series is just plain fun even years later most episodes are light on plotline but the appeal of its three stars make up for that kate jackson farrah fawcettmajors and jaclyn smith have a chemistry unmatched by any of the future angel pairings season one contains the series most quotinfamousquot episode quotangels in chainsquot every single quotwomen in prisonquot cliche is herethe brutal prison matrons the leacherous sheriff and deputy the crooked warden and of course the obligatory shower scene this is probably the highlight of the seasonthis dvd collection gets high marks for including the original movie pilot although the pilot movie is just average i havent seen it since it first aired so it was a nice bonus although jaclyn smith is featured prominently in the pilot it was meant to be a showcase for kate jackson kate for whom the series was created was originally supposed to play kelly garrett but decided to play sabrina at the last minute thus jaclyn smith gets most of the screen time in the movieunfortunately the pilot movie is the best that can be said about the extras in the dvd collection it also contains a rather dull featurette called quotangels foreverquot which consists of a lot of geeky fans reminiscing about the series tv land and the e network had much better features about the series alas none of the stars are featured offering their thoughts on the series the dvd also does not contain chapter selections for each episode which is rather irritating the packaging of the collection is certainly sparse as well each disc is contained in a flimsy plastic cover hopefully sony entertainment will correct these issues in future seasonsi suspect the appeal of this series lies predominantly with those of us who remember when it first aired in the s today its hard to believe this innocent cheesey little show caused as much controversy as it did its nice to see that chuckys girls are still fun to watch after all these years
my sister loved hopscotch with walter matthau and sam waterston her favorite scene in the movie was near the end when the plane crashes and all are standing on the cliff watching someone says well hes dead sam waterston in the significant ending scene says sonofa b better stay bought the vhs for my sister on her birthday that entire favorite part was cut out of the video i know she was disappointed movies should never be cut the scenes are there to keep the flow and to make statements ive had this happen with a few other older films as well how can we be sure this doesnt happen again when ordering online
i loved the show as a kid and still enjoyed it as an adult at of the reviews i read this video by anchor bay with this cover is the one to get or supposedly a japanese version has all of the original music but i could not find one i personally dont see how anyone can remember al of the exact songs and realize they were changedthere are a few good episodes on season but as mentioned in some bonus commentaries i think in season the stories were getting worse and way too cheesy with sea monsters weird aliens and ghosts that seems like a weird comment given the story about a super hero with an alien suit but even for this show the stories were lacking the originality and capability and just out of placeseason two also accelerated the use of the powers of the suit without letting the viewers see ralph discovering them which was part of the charm of the original story all of the sudden he has two or more powers he is familiar withsome of the storiesepisodes seemed way too short and they were setting the show up to end already in this season talking about other heroes and everyone discovering ralph with the suit among other things i guess that is bound to happen with a super hero without a maskaccording to the writers and actors commentaries the extra cheesiness of the new aliens monsters and ghosts was the reason the series ended they said it was the direction the execs wanted them to go and the morons ruined it there was so much potential to keep to the original story about a regular guy dealing with the gift of a goofy suit in a somewhat realistic world and how people would really reactthe movie casebooklet design on this one is pretty nice too there are individual cases which can hold dvds each and they are stored in a outer casethey reused a lot of footage like a merry go round of jumping flying and landing which got a bit too boring but i found it kind of fun to watch for the wires and the stunt man which did not take much to noticenot so sure if i want season now mostly because of the stories going downhill and the prices for season are nearly times more ill have to read up on more reviews and think about it ill likely buy it since i like the show and want to see more
i truly enjoyed this episode although cringing through some of it it has some of the worst best gore scenes i have seen in a while youve got people sticking their heads in steel traps sewing their own nose and mouth shut gutting themselves and of course what meat loaf does at the end in excruciatingly slow detaili guess its all about what one man will do for a piece of pie and what raccoons will do when you mess with themkudos to dario argento for finally having a good episode in this series very cool very gross very fun
i have enjoyed over the past month watching all the doc martin season series it took me a while to adjust to understanding his character as he seemed rude arrogant and impersonal but as time went on i grew to appreciate his character and laughed a lot about things he did and how he reacted it was very entertaining and for the biggest part pretty wholesome entertainment i had been told by my mother about the doc martin series of shows and i resisted even trying them out especially with the first one but once i understood his character i really enjoyed watching i fear i am done with the series so alas i will just have to start once again from the beginning and enjoy them all over again good show old chap
s i write this there is an opportunity to pay at least for this abomination trust medont its obscure for a good reason cult classic no you might have to be put on suicide watch if you realize you paid for such dreck david carradine was capable of doing a good job as the wandering loner with formidable combat capability given the right production teamdirection and a good story but he had none of these to help him here he wasnt normally capable of elevating a bad script and even so he didnt appear to be making much effort at all in this bomb witness the very lazy fight scenes with barely glancing or missed blows swords that appear to be made of tin even bad dubbing its amazing how few of the s barbarian movies were done with any class at all it makes you appreciate how the magnificent conan the barbarian really is the citizen kane of that movement even the movie poster is laughable with the highly romanticized illustrated version of carradines physique lol parody worthy itself this could have easily been fodder for mstk maybe it was its a shame to see carradine involved in such a low brow project given that he wasnt very many years past his best early work but i guess there is a certain kind of value in the horribleness of the movie worth a few chuckles but a lot more groans from the sock puppet pet of the effeminate fat warlord with no apparent reason for being leader to the cardboard appearance of the castle walls your eyes wont stop rolling for the entire film a rare bright spot was the always mostly naked body of mariacutea socas and a few other pointlessly naked women who had absolutely no relevant connection to the plot rather than just very little like maria this is the sword and sorcery equivalent to king solomons mines indiana jones imitator with sharon stonesuch a shameless and inferior ripoff of a proven blockbuster you have to laugh but instead of a quivering giant rubber spider in king solomons mines we are treated to a quivering giant rubber octobeast with dinosaurlike mouth full of sharp teeth the mind boggles at the thought of sane adults being able to film this edit it have time to reflect on it then release it to the public if you really like campy cmovies make sure to only pick this up as part of the quad pack with deathstalker movies and barbarian queen and wait to buy it used and cheap as in well under for all four movies dont rush
i first saw reservoir dogs on video and i remember very vividly that first experience of seeing such a fascinating story told in such an original way it would begin my love affair with anything tarantino threw on screen because its so clear that this is a man who loves movies and reservoir dogs was such a great way to begin his career with a bangreservoir dogs is the story of a heist gone terribly awry its discovered through typical tarantino flashbackstyle that one of the members of the heist team is really an undercover agent meant to disrupt it problems result and one of the members of the team tim roth takes a vicious hit to the stomach as the heist ends in an unexpected shootout and the other surviving members of the team are left in a warehouse fighting the clock to figure out who the rat was as well as what to do with their team member who is dying in front of themwatchin these men turn on each other as they try to figure out who was the plant how to save roth and how are they going to explain this to the boss makes for a story that has surprising depth and twists tarrantino is a master with dialogue and this was the film that set his bar extremely highthe casting for this was impeccable as well michael madsen is flawless as vic vega the hitman who takes pleasure in his dirty worki gaurantee you that you will never be able to listen to stuck in the middle with you without cringing ever again steve buchemi as the bit player hitman who wants a bigger part and may just get it in spite of himself and harvey keitel as the one who takes tim roths character under his wing to mentor him and must make hard and fast choices to keep him alive keitel also was so impressed with tarrantinos script that he was the driving force in getting the financing and took a serious pay cut to have the film made chris penn also has a terrific turn as the thugbossson trying to run the show on his own and scrambing to figure out why everyting went so wrongthis film is absolutely amazing and the dvd is by no means a wast of money repeat viewings offer different insights into the story and help build on ones appreciation of it also the extras are really better than you would expect on a film this old
i saw this in the theater when i was in high school and took my girlfriend at the time ha ha ten minutes into this movie i forgot she was even with me elvira aka cassandra peterson is funny beautiful and the most talanted woman alive with a pair of tassleswhen she inherits a house in new england she doesnt know her evil uncle is after a book of spells within with two bumbling henchmen he seeks to get it elvira ends up saving the day with the help of the neighborhood kids and gonk highlight scenes are many since elvira stars in this movie and is in almost every scene i mean how could you ever get enough of this woman sexy funny and a woman who knows how to dress for success there is not another movie out there anywhere with more sight gags and jokes about boobs
this is the second time i have viewed this series first when it aired on television and now i have the great opportunity to view this again on my amazon prime i dont know why the series was discontinued although it may have been due to the popularity of the sopranos at the time and they were somewhat competitive in themes the acting is right up there the scenes are raw and uncensored yet blended into a story line that draws the viewer deeper and deeper into the lives of this irish american family and good sonbad son episodes one brother a politician the other a thug please check the showtime review and enjoy it through amazon prime
isnt a place its a state of mind a perfect tagline for this nontypical teen movie shaun brumder colin hanks has committed himself to writing after he found a novel by a stanford professor at the beach his friend died trying to surf the big one and he decided to go to stanford to study with the famous professor skinner shauns dreams are put on a halt when his high school counselor sent in the wrong transcript typical school counselor he tries everything to get into the college with the help of his girlfriend schuyler fisk and his smelly brother jack black the commercial for this movie is deceiving and i thought i was going to see jack black more often in his dirty underwear ha too bad you get a real movie with a good message and touching characters watch out for the old man in the wheelchair and john lithgow almost saying the f word whoa chevy chase is in the movie for about a minute and doesnt say much yes even kevin kline and ben stiller make cameos how outrageous is that have you seen my pants the commercial ruined that line good movie
h dearits easy to tell where this latest version of conan doyles perennial classic goes wrong because so little goes right theres little fault with the script which does a decent job of retelling a by now overly familiar tale and even throws in an intriguingly gothic christmas eve party for good measure some of the supporting performances are fine john nettles and richard e grant in particular but the leads are so very wrong that they sap the life from the thingian harts watson is surly and obnoxious all too easily offended and trapped in a deeply distrustful relationship with holmes since watson has to carry much of the drama this keeps us at arms length from involvement especially since matt day is such a dull baskerville however where hart is a good actor giving a misjudged performance richard roxburgh gives every indication of being a bad actor giving a bad performance he may not quite be the worst holmes in the way that he was definitely the worst dracula in van helsing but hes certainly the dullest and blandest despite his overstated distance and eccentricities while the attempt to make him more of an action hero simply ends up making him a very ordinary figure instead with all displays of holmes deductive reasoning dropped even the famous scene with dr mortimers walking stick is gone his disguises omitted he just appears on the moor as if he were still dressed for baker street and his drug use wildly overdone rather than resorting to narcotics when bored he even jacks up in a public toilet while working on the case in this version hes such a blunt bull in a china shop here that rather than pay the cabby for information he beats him up instead as if he were a th century popeye doylealthough david attwoods direction throws up the odd good bit of composition the grotty lighting and perpetual green tint on the original tv broadcast version sap any signs of life before they can bloom and the less said about the shoddily animated cgi hound the better despite the impressively populated london street scenes its hard to believe that this is probably the biggest budgeted version since rathbone and bruce strode the moorthe bbc have previously had good luck with the tale both their peter cushing and tom baker versions studiobound though they were were more involving in their cosy sunday teatime way sadly this attempt to bring a more modern aesthetic while marginally better than the dreadful peter cook and dudley moore spoof is nonetheless a very poor show indeed
this is a classic military defense that succeeded if one watches both this film and the contrast is obvious at rorkes drift the defense was by disciplined british infantry and the defensive position was laid out by a military engineer who knew what he was doing in fortifying the site discipline and good planning ensured successthere are a number of films about historic last stand defenses including and where defenses failed and the defenders were massacred and days at and where the defenses were successful perhaps there is a message in this ie succeed or die if failure is equated with death there is a high incentive to do your utmost these were no type situations there were no noncombatantsi remember someone asking once about the significance of officers commissioning dates in this case it made a great deal of difference and resulted in the engineer officer having overall command he obviously had better training in designing and building defensive works even ones that used walls fences wagons and sandbags or grain bags the final redoubt was a doordie last line of defenseoverall the film is very good and seems to stick to the historic situation it would be interesting to know what finally happened to chard bromfield and the others

such a fun family movie i saw this in the theater and it was one of the best film experiences i had this past summer this film was really overlooked by the general public because it came out after despicable me and monsters university two sequels to two massively popular films dreamworks really dropped the ball on the release date it should have came out later in the year and i think the box office return would have been much higher hopefully this film will find its place on blu ray and dvd much like the under appreciated dreamworks film rise of the guardians that came out last christmas
this girl is just awesome angelina jolie was made to play lara croft this movei is filled with everything lara more shots of the manor shes also traveling a lot more like africa and beijing also this story is based on something really like pandoras box lara is then partnered up with what i call the hotness terry sheriden this movie is really great a lot better then the first ine theres a lot more action in this one and what i think more story i also heard angelina jolie signed a contract saying she will do more tomb raider movies i bet when they have a tomb raider three ill be first to buy the ticket
just when i thought full moon was making a comeback with killjoy goes to hellwe get this ooga booga actually could have been alot better than what it was it simply fell flat on its face lame story lame acting and the only positive i could see was the ooga bogga character itself was realistic looking and had his moments of comedy since he couldnt talk though it was pretty limited i wont rewrite the story as other reviewers already have done it well come on full moon get serious or fold sadly puppet master has been ruined beyond repair with those absolutely terrible part etc etc i wont even get into those pathetic gingerdead man movies bottom lineyouve had too many flops over the last years to make something this bad us old school full moon fans still have a slice of faith in you hope your next effort is a whole lot better than this
this was by far my favorite jet li film it really was great the action had of course some rather unrealistic parts but that is rather inevitable but the storyline is actually quite good predictable to a certain degree but still very good the progression of the character of the protagonist was laudable i thoroughly enjoyed this film with this version you get the original film and the unrated version the unrated version is the same as the original except that there is more blood and violence several shots of blood gushing or arms actually snapping so whether you want the gore or not this dvd has both great buy
the android invasion is one of those dr who adventures that had vividly impressed my nine year old imagination some years ago like ark in space genesis of the daleks and pyramids of mars for good reason too as the story plot was crafted by the legendary terry nations edited by another iconic writer robert holmes and fleshed out with some very poignant scenes however for those simply seeking the best of early dr who may pass on this adventureas much as i hold android invasion as one of my personal favorites the pacing is a bit loose often jilting between action and slow bits of fillin static dialogue the plot mystery cliffhanger revelations are all superb all directed by the man who would know this unitrelated story format best barry letts was the producer for the rd doctors adventures yet the feel is perhaps too reminiscent of the pertwee era and too avengersesque all the perfect ingredients are there from production talent to the now seamless team of tom baker and elizabeth sladen yet plot holes and quite a few costuming deficiencies producer hinchcliffes own regret sopradic dry dialogue although a few immortal quips are present and the aforementioned pacing just can not compare to the truly best of dr whoside note this episode does mark the final appearance of both onetime companion harry sullivan and the stalwart unit fixture benton as the unit aspect of dr who stories slides into a very long term abeyanc
with all due respect to jason frekot roger waters performs his pink floyd and solo material on this dvd to perfection ok its not pink floyd but his band is excellent he has made every effort to be true to the original floyd recordings which in and of itself is a tribute to his old bandmates including syd would we say that paul mccartney or ringo starr cant sing any beatles songs in concert and that we should condemn them any time they do no this concert is a wonderful trip through roger waters musical history well played well produced and well worth owning
bob clarks quota christmas storyquot is a cinematic slice of americana it chronicles an era long since gone when a bb gun was the dream present of every young child and when saying the wrong word would set up a meeting between your mouth and a bar of soapyoung ralphie parker peter billingsley longs for a daisy red ryder shot carbine action bb gun and makes no secret that he wants one for christmas however everyone in his northern indiana town warns him that he will shoot his eye out if his wish is granted ralphie stubbornly refuses to waver and hopes against hope that his wish will be granted while navigating around the other problems in his life a school bully a brother who has outgrown his snowsuit an aunt who thinks hes a girl a hazardous visit to santa claus at the department store a tongue stuck on a frozen lamp post and a decoder ring that decodes an uninspiring messagethere really is nothing that distinguishes quota christmas storyquot from your runofthemill seasonal madefortelevision christmas production the feeling of nostalgia that the film generates basically is its only notable aspect the jokes are routine and the characters are the typical generic stock figures you would find in any modern christmas tale darren mcgavin and melinda dillon are amusing as ralphies parents and billingsley has a short of charm as young ralphie but the performances arent special enough to elevate the material quota christmas storyquot does a wonderful job of recreating a certain place and time however it does not accomplish much more than that in the realm of bigscreen christmas features quota christmas storyquot places somewhere in the middle of the pack
this is a good old thriller the only minus in this whole thing is that donna mills cant act worth a hoot but shes got the most amazing blue eyes so i guess that makes up for it shot in and around my hometown area fun to look at stuff like the outside shots of the sardine factory which still exists and see how empty the streets were of buildings at that timejessica walters delivers the performance of a lifetime and cmon its clint eastwood how could that be bad enough of twists and turns to keep you guessing and a great endingive probably watched this movie a good dozen times including when it first came out in the theaters i dont get tired of it and i know whats gon na happen
the beginning part of the movie is alright and the ending of the movie is fine the middle is extremely boring the beginning has carol kane as a babysitter receiving strange phone calls the middle focuses on the caller now loose and running around the city with a bit of memory loss the ending has the confrontation which was pretty descent it would have been better if there would have been a bit more catmouse chase in it the pi looking for the caller didnt do much for mehe seemed more awkward than needed i actually enjoyed the remake much better also aside from some trailers there isnt anything extra on the dvd which is somewhat disappointing
when this film was released in the critics were not kind but i love this film and think its a good telling of the story of david based on i and ii samuel i chronicles and the psalms though much of it has been compressed davids relationship with bathsheba is limited mostly to the consequences of it for instance and some creative license used for plot continuity it has a tremendous amount of biblical accuracytaking place from to bc the costuming sets and artifacts are fabulous filmed in pinewood studios uk and on location in italy the cinematography by donald mcalpine is wonderful the score is also lovely by carl davisthe brief nudity in the wedding chamber sequence has in my tape been darkened so as to be imperceptible either this is a flaw in the tape or an effort not to offend and capture a wider audience which would be silly as this is a very mature drama it contains much brutal violence making it unsuitable for children and the confrontation with goliath for example which is exceptionally well done is one of four beheadingsrichard gere is a marvelous david and stands up well against an excellent international cast he was thirtyfive when this was filmed and is about as handsome as a human has a right to be the actor who shines above all though is edward woodward as saul he is riveting and its a brilliant character study of courage mixed with jealousy revenge and madnessthis is far from being a quotbig bible epicquot with lots of well known stars instead its serious and beautifully acted and perhaps arrived on the scene at the wrong time that it was so unappreciated two decades ago total running time is minutesquotit is through the heart the heart alone that god speaks to manquot
quite good if not perfect sequel movie to the robotech tv series has finally come to dvd the production values are very good considering the films low budget and the story is excellent it does suffer somewhat from the relatively short runtime there is not quite sufficient time for us to get to know characters sufficiently to care as much about them as we should nonetheless given the limitations of the form the harmony golddr movie production team has done just about as good a job with the material as they possibly could haveas for the dvd itself the audio and video transfer is extremely good i didnt spot any obvious glitches on my own equipment the discs only extra worth mentioning is a minute featurette on the making of the film it would have been nice to have an audio commentary and deleted scenes but what is there is a lot better than anime dvds usually get
utside providence was based on a book by peter farelly and at first glance it is not your typical farelly brothers movie its as funny as many other farelly brothers movies but the gross out jokes and over the top gags are more reigned in this is more of a coming ageromantic comedy rather than another dumb and dumber when this movie first came out it seemed to equally disapoint critics and fans because it was either derivitive or just not up to the stature of theres something about mary some critics complained about alec balwins acting or that this was really a its true the kids do smoke pot a lot and one of tim dumphys best friends is named drugs but this is really about the lead character tim dumphy is a likeable character goes out of his way for friends and family for example he leaves school travels hours by bus just to take his brother to a patriots game how many brothers would do that there is also a romantic side to dumph who falls in love with the most beautiful girl in school jane but as dumph tells his friends he doesnt even care whether he has sex with or not how many teenage guys are like that alec baldwin turns in another great performance as the hard ass dad who calls dump but you can tell he loves his son and just wants whats best for him there are a few unnecessary moments like the heart to heart between dump and his father and the other between alec balwin and his poker buddies its one homophobic joke after another are we supposed to believe that just because their working class guys that their supposed to be ignorant otherwise this is a wonderful comedy with good acting and a heartwarming story
is this a dark comedy is this a dark romance a drama the only thing i know for sure is when i discovered it on ifc fifteen plus years ago you knowwhen ifc was actually a channel devoted to independent film unlike the abomination it has become it completely blew me away and filled my heart its been on my top ten movies list ever sincewe have what isnt really a love story respect and admire says matthew slaughter between a man and a pregnant year old girl by the school quarterback not slaughter she starts the movie as a snotty brash teen who thinks she has the world figured out she meets matthew after being kicked out of the house they dont exactly click in terms of love but wow do they click emotionally theyre exactly what each other needs at this point in their lives by the end of the film shes done a lot of growing up surrounding them is his abusive father and her dysfunctional mother and sister mom in particular is an incredibly memorable characterthe dialogue is short simple and to the point the acting is monotone almost deadpan the shooting is unconventional with conversation going on between parties who arent even in the shot its completely ridiculous and yet its perfect its absolutely perfectthe bluray release isnt exactly reference level the picture is pretty soft probably dnrd heavily the image looks like it was largely shot through a blue filter which may indeed be the case the mono soundtrack can be poppy and unevenly balanced but i dont care i cant believe its taken this long to get to dvd let alone bluray this fills a huge hole in my collection
i loved disneys mary poppins i was eager to watch this film to see the making of the movie is an interesting look at the process p l travers is portrayed as annoyingly eccentric but not necessarily mean spirited to the core i have a feeling the real ms travers was more harsh and razor edged from her background shared in the movie i tried to understand the impact her childhood had on her reluctance to share marys story with disney i wanted to give her all benefit of doubt alias its a movie not a documentary as ms travers softens you can sort of like her almost as if disney administered his own spoonful of sugar to make the movie go downher dad is portrayed as having an alcohol problem and his death is foretold by his spitting up blood a bit graphic for kids are you ready for tb questions tom hanks was a great disney ive watched it twice its a good movie maybe not what i expected but a good movie none the less
march of the penguins follows a year in the life of the male and female emperor penguins after a summer of frolicking in the refreshing artic waters and building up body fat they begin the long trek to their sheltered mating ground area miles away here at what looks like a massive penguin cocktail party the penguins pair off one by one looking for all the world like they are head over heels in love each of these unions produces a single egg which the mother passes to the father to protect for the winter months while she returns to the ocean to feed as giving birth has left her near starvationonce the mothers leave the fathers huddle together enduring unimaginably hazardous conditions in order to ensure the safe hatching of their little chicks eventually the mothers return to meet and nourish their little ones while the fathersnow near starvation themselvestake their own turn at feeding amazingly the fathers are able to learn the unique call of their newborns so that they will be able to find each other upon their return the father and mother continue to switch places until finally the entire family is ready to make the journey back to the sea and the reluctant youngsters are ready to set forth on their ownalthough ive seen many national geographic and similar tv specials telling much the same story featured here seeing this films stunningly gorgeous photography on the wide screen definitely made the trip to the theater worth it although i would recommend this as a family film i would caution parents of young children as the little ones might well be frightened by the treacherous snow storms as well as several penguin deaths including the loss of a chick and the capture of an adult by a seal overall however i highly recommend this feature particularly to anyone who would like to witness the miracle life as evidenced by one very resilient species

i have to say when i first saw the reviews for this movie online i thought people were being overly critical of an otherwise good movie however i have to say after renting this movie from netflix over the weekend i have to say that the reviews are spot on overall this movie has its moments but it certainly has earned its criticisms because with the exception of a few rare moments of good wit this movie would have been a waste of to buy and only end up watching just once this way i watch it once return it and then i never have to see it collecting dust on my shelf ever again if given a chance to recommend this movie i would say to keep looking because this movie would be a waste of an evening
i believe after the exorcist the exorcist series just stedily went down hill pt lost its fear factor the beginning lost its fear factor and lacked good effects dominion had no fear factor at all the effects sucked the plotline was not original and it was boaring the acting was poor and the movie was about an hour too long if you want to see movies with great possession scenes check out the first two exorcist movies stigmata the exorcism of emily rose or american haunting dont watch this even if it comes on the tv youll be waisting your time
this is a pretty good film with anne hathaway as andy sachs the recent college grad trying to break into journalism who takes the only available job as junior assistant to the highpowered editor of the leading fashion magazine shes earnest and cute and bright but meryl streep as miranda priestly queen of fashionistas and priestess of the dark side of the force is spectacular as the tagline says miranda is on sadistic hyperdemanding not knowing when to quit lacking in the most basic humanity willing to blow another marriage happy to sacrifice everything and everyone around her convinced that no one else in the universe is capable of doing her job and yet million girls would for andys job it takes awhile but andy eventually of course discovers shes becoming too much like miranda and manages to save herself at the last minute its a little too pat but i enjoy watching the fashion industry being skewered
denzel washington and mark wahlberg are great together denzels ability to play a role with intense seriousness and at the same time exude extremely intelligent underlying humor in a character and marks ability to toss out hilarious quips and innuendo from a character that has a devil may care attitude because of his over inflated ego blend together to make this a truly great movie action packed with enough humor intertwined to be enjoyable to the man and woman of the house actually for most of the family violence and occasional adult themes may be a little too much for children
to this day the exorcist remains the scariest film of all time in my opinion but this film is the second scariestim sure it was somewhat inspired by the afore mentioned but thats ok because it workseven today this film stands up and still scares and thrillsthis is the story of what happened before the family from the original amityville horror moved inthere are sub plots involving incest and domestic abuse and they are disturbing as are a lot of content in horror films todaythe scares come when the older brother sonny played by jack magner slowly becomes posessed by a demon and starts acting dementedanother thing that was so effective was how slowly physical transformation took placei actually think he was more frightening halfway through the transformation but again the end result was still effectivethe atmosphere such as musicsound and visuals were done extremely well as to keep it creepy and scary because it could have easily gone the other wayburt young and rutanya alda rounded out a great ensemble casti dont think this movie ever got the accolades it deserved because it was a sequel and the comparison to the exorcist
quotsnow whitequot is a gem on dvd and is a classic for all time not only did this film influence every future animated short and feature film it also was directly responsible for mgm bringing quotthe wizard of ozquot to the screen all the computer animated wizardry in the world can not replicate the charm and craftmanship of the detailed animation in this film its only weakness is that some of the comedic antics of the dwarfs simply go on for too long yet thats a minor complaint about a lush and enjoyable film such as this dont think the wicked queen isnt scary to young kids she is just ask my fouryear old niece also i have to say that quotsnow whitequot is more of a liberated heroine than she is given credit for she uses charm friendship and negotiation to set up refuge in the dwarfs cottage yet is oldfashioned enough to still want romance too many of disneys modern animated heroines are just too abrasive for their own good i know this is not politically correct but so what the dvd transfer is great but why do we have to wait through endless commercials when we play the disc again as well as having to sit through the magic mirror menu over and over a small price to pay for such a great product but still a price
the creepy part about this movie is within its simplicity a car arrives to terrorize a small sleepy town in the mid west it kills several people and in ways that is does not make sense to the people in the town for an example it killed one woman by crashing through her home no one was able to understand how it sliced a home in half feet off the ground with no apparent ramp at another point in the movie it does a fishtail turn to the side and rolls over two police cars flattening them and kills the cops inside only to wind up back on its wheels and it keeps going down the road with barely a scratch in the end they decide to blow up a whole canyon to burry the thing since it has killed off most of the cops in the sleepy little town a bit of a hint to whom might be driving the car at the end but i dont want to give it awaythe movie ends with credits while the car makes a trip to some kind of generic american city so many victims and so little time kind of reminds me of an old computer game called carmageddonthis was a movie that was made back when big budgets were not always needed to make a good movie the movie does not clearly dictate if anyone is in the car or not but kinda hints that no one is this movie might even be what inspired steven king to write christine in the end this movie would have been a classic and a hit in the theaters if it did not come out at the same time as star wars
mom and dad are splitting up so mom is dragging kids to beat up old house she inherited from nutty relative whose scientist father disappeared many years before one of the boys discovers the scientists old journal full of magical and protective spells then he discovers that the house is domicile to some pretty strange creatures as well as surrounded by some evil ones who are trying to get in the house and gain control of the journal the film would be pretty loud violent and messy for sensitive kids sturdy kids could see it at about the special effects were fairly clever and the child actors were talented
you have watched this film or will be watching it because either youre a vincent gallo fan or a courtney cox fan its very unlikely that you like them both whoever cast them mustve been on some very strong stuff to not have noticed that there isnt any sort of chemistry between them and considering that in this dull story they are supossed to be in love chemistry is an important fact vincent gallo is one artist that ive always respected hes an all around great artist his directorial debut and one of his best performances buffalo has become a favorite of mine since the first time i watched it his talent does not fall short in this film either no one can portray depression like he can i guess but the film itself just doesnt go anywhere the repeated theme that money and success doesnt give you happiness and that love is the answer is such an abused theme that it should be placed on the discontinued shelf somewhere i dont understand why vincent gallo took the offer to act in this film hes known for being very picky in choosing his films this does not seem like a choice he would make as far as courteney cox goes im truly surprised that actors as talentless as her actually have a career when there are thousands of starving actors out there that could use roles like this i tried watching this movie times and on the th i finally finished it it really couldnt hold my attention i would not recomend this film to anyone unless youre a friends fan it might appeal to your taste but if youre watching this because mr gallo is in it i would skip it and rent palookaville instead
i think the woman writing the book was actually the whole movie and that what we were watching was the book she published in the end i think this because the writer older woman always said she writes crime books and mysteries and stuff and thats what happens in the movie the lady just put her self as a character in the book with julie and julie and her are first enemies then become allies when the murder happens i liked this film it moved slow and confusing and times but i think i understood the twisting plot and i love ludivine julie i always have good movie
when you think youve seen the best there is it seems like something always comes along to top it this is one of those thingseverything about this series except disc is stunningeverything so much so that in several instances you will find your jaw dropped without knowing itnow disc i only made it through about ten minutes of it but i can only assume that the whole thing is dedicated to telling me how precarious the whole planet is and how its ready to fall out of orbit unless we act now to save it if youre into that foolish hysteria then it will be icing on the cake for an otherwise unbelievable set of dvdsi highly highly recommend this set
i appreciate horror movies like the changeling hellraiser and interview with the vampire however there is nothing to appreciate about phantasm its one of the worst horror movies ive ever seen the plot is discombobulated the acting is mediocre the dialogue is too weird there isnt suspense or intrigue and it was very boring and vapid the special effects were good but they arent anything different from the nightmare on elm street series in fact the director of phantasm seems to have borrowed too much from nightmare on elm street do not waste your time watching this trite trash this is not a classic
in death game locke and camp play a pair of women who essentially seek thrills without concern for others as a matter of fact the more they can torture someone the more enjoyment they get from it with a premise like this you would certainly hope they would get more mileage from it but alas the biggest threat they pose to their married man they have imprisoned in his own home is talking him to death locke and camp are effective in their roles and can certainly turn on the sex appeal while being so menacing that you would not want to get near them they have plenty of dialogue too much and a director who likes to linger on scenes too long this comes off rather like a stage play on film there is of course the payoff scene of locke and camp in a bath together which should wake you up at that point i will not give it away but the final scene involving the van is well shot i watched this scene several times in slow motion and it was still effective overall death game is a film with a lot of talk and a lot of tease with very little payoff considering the potential they had with the subject matterbob
scream factory have done an amazing job releasing this mid s obscurity from cannon films the bluray transfer looks absolutely amazing and the sound quality is excellent as well there is also an audio commentary track on the disc by director sam firstenberg and stunt coordinator steve lambert which is one of the most interesting and comprehensive commentary tracks on film making a very informative dissection of how an action film is constructed and made as well as the amazing influence and input a stunt team has on the production of a filmi was left completely satisfied after viewing the film with the commentary track and it left me with an appreciation for the art of film making i highly recommend this disc for the commentary track alone and hope that scream factory will release all their films with such great transfers and special featuresid love for them to release american ninja on bluray in the near future and in the mean time i will be exploring more of their great releasesbuy this and have a blast
timelife nbcuniversal and the dean martin family trust finally got their act together and released six complete episodes from dinos variety hour admittedly the selected broadcasts do not represent the laidback series at its absolute best still the threedisc set offers memorable performances by martin and his diverse guest stars unique talents we will never see again a particular favorite is the january program featuring deans got a tiger by the duet with buck owens and the magical presence of orson welles compared to s primetime wasteland which lacks any trace of spontaneity dean martin delivers far more entertainment value
if you know opeths music then you must own this dvd periodthat said the film editing leaves something to be desired with six cameramen youd think that the film editordirector could have chosen the best possible angle and used that but no often its merely a snippet of a blistering guitar solo as the point of view changes every three seconds and while one can appreciate the attempt to capture the full sonic affect of an opeth song by fast cutting to various band members at times the affect is to wonder why you are hearing a guitar lead but not seeing itso opeth gets a out of for music the director gets a out of for visuals you can do the math and despite my minor quibble this is an incredible document of a staggering performance just buy it
massacre in dino valley is a special blend of the cannibal and boys adventure genres that shouldnt be missed by fans of italian exploitation its lighter in the gore department than most spaghetti cannibal shockers and thankfully theres no real life animal mutilation but it pours on the sex and nudity we have several rapes one of which is a nasty lesbian rape that seems pulled straight out of a wip movie and a fifteen minute or so stretch when the two main actresses simply stop wearing clothesthats right they parade around the jungle nekkid they even paddle around in a canoe with leading man michael sopkiw while topless theres also a crazed vietnam vet who looks like a poor mans bo svenson theres also a visual django reference one goofy fight scene with absurd sound effects one crazy italianstyle brawl that looks as if it were choreographed by blind midgets and lots of shootingand sopkiw has a sawedoff pump shotgun that looks really fly worth owning
n energetic bounty hunter gerard butler gets a case that is right up his alley he is assigned to bring in his exwife nicole jennifer aniston we already know the story and have a feel for what is about to happen the fun comes in the execution if you saw the commercials that is just about it however there is a place where a rigshaw boy asks to see nicoles boobs do not get your hopes upthis is not a film for someone looking for uniqueness or any depth of thought it is action with intenti only saw the bluray version great picture and sound quality you can see that jennifer is hitting her fortiesoffice space special edition with flair bluray
documentaries of real poltergeists and hauntings dont want it yeah we get a full featured world of included with this special edition but who is warner brothers kidding here this is not unsolved mysteries this is a classic movie where is the making where is the story of the poltergiest curse which includes death of cast members and some poeple in involed with the movie where is the story of heather o rourkes sudden death where is the controverisal heated story between the director tobe hooper and producer spielberg youre not going to get anything about it no cast interviews no storylines about the movies infancy nothing about the making of the movie just another decent documentary about hauntings and poltergesits and contacting the dead which has nothing to do with the movie itself in all seriousness there is nothing wrong with the documentary included with the film but it just doesnt belong hereas for the movie itself we know how awesome it is and yes it does look like its been cleaned up quite a bit boasting it being digitally restored and remastered it probably true its defintely the best looking poltergeist ive ever seen on my tv the audio even seemed to get an upgrade too as fans know this came out years ago in wow has it been that long but amazingly it has still withstood the test of time as is still considered to be one of the best movies ever made i personally believe the movie is spielbergs best more than et close encounters you name it poltergeist is probalby his best work while tobe hooper takes credit for being the director thats where the controversy starts between hooper and spielberg and i can honestly thats why wb has ignored a full fledged making of the movie knowing the controversy it may spawn between hooper and spielberg but even without the interviews or making of the movie if you havent bought this movie yet now is probably a good time just dont expect any good extras that have anything to do with the movie
in my generation president kennedy was as all presidents were before the flower generation sans reproche above sharp personal criticism he was a war hero by all telling of this story back then and knight in shining armor of the american camelot a leader loved and envied by all the good peoples of the earth all of us kids then especially young boys were enthralled by the story of his wwii heroism as the commander of pt in that time most people in the civilized and reading nations on the planet knew his storyif you do not know it kennedys patrol torpedo boat was rammed and sunk by a japanese destroyer for the next days jack kennedy led and inspired the eleven survivors until rescue came which he had a personal part in arranging thats the story in a sentence or two that courage suffering good and bad fortune played parts in the story can not be denied thats what this movie depicts but in the story was wrapped in too much patriotism and somewhat cliched roles and some very whitewashed shortened and wooden acting by principal characters this is not entirely the fault of the actors but more from the fact that the story was produced under the direct guidance of studio owner jack warner interviews with some cast and crew members in the past fifty years mention rewrites of events and characters to emphasize and perhaps deify the story of a future president who was in office as the movie was being produced was a personal friend of mr warner as well and was hero of the non communist world at the height of the cold war this is not to lesson the courage of lt kennedy but lets not all think his were the only heroic acts by the shipwrecked american sailors it would be interesting to see a remake of this story today by a hollywood that has told more accurate realistic and gritty stories for the screen since the sas a wwii war film give it about a six out of ten for actionits there but sort of limp and acted too stiffly even compared to the earlier s war films and patriotic themes they were expendable tells another pt boat and historic events story an it had john wayne doing his usual over the top patriot wooden acting heres a great movie does have three inanimate starsreplica elco pt boats rebuilds from aviation crash rescue boats that the us military was retiring just as the movie was in preproduction planningallinall the movie is like able and a simplistic telling of a true story that has become a part of american politicalhistorical legend
there are a lot of movies out there on the market that deal with the same or similar type of themegenre as presented in ie ron clark of the etchowever is one of the best i have seen so far in this type of genre the acting by all cast members is fabulous the storyline the way in which the material is presented is extremely well done by the screenwriters director cinematography and so is a very inspiring story based on the real life teacher erin gruwell whom rises to the challenge in making a difference in the lives of her students when erin gruewell comes along as a rookie teacher fresh out of college she ends up making a real connection with her students and gets them interested in learning hence the students are now interested in learning because they can see they do have a future and so they end up achieving better grades and overall test scoreseducation is a wonderful thing and it is wonderful to know there are many outstanding teachers in this world willing to go beyond the extra mile to teach future generations of young people
what happens when two environmental activists come head to head with mcdonalds in court one side has billions of dollars or pounds since this is in england unlimited human resources to produce evidence witnesses and lawyers and the other side has two environmental activists it doesnt necessarily turn out as youd expectmclibel is the story of just such a scenario beginning with events as early as this lowbudget documentary unfolds the tale of two activists dave morris and helen steel a postal worker and a gardener respectively who refused to bow to mcdonalds demands and instead ended up facing the fast food giant in court for a libel case over an antimcdonalds pamphlet they had handed outthe footage is fairly lowbudget but it hardly matters because it is edited together in such an expert storytelling fashion with almost years of footage unfolding bit by bit its hard to look away the audience watches as the case that was supposed to end in weeks ends up lasting and a half years through the introduction of the internet the two defendants are given a broader audience and thus able to call in more expert witnesses to help theminterviews with fast food nation scribe eric schlosser and several other experts on the subject help move the plot along and add substance to this delightful documentary the court reenactments are a bit forced considering they have actors playing the roles of the characters in court but i guess it would be difficult to reenact the court testimonial in any other way also it feels a bit as if the defense is overplaying their hand when they try to lay the blame on mcdonalds for the mcdonalds litter lying around the streets and the overly mechanized qaulity of a mcdonalds kitchen they are a business after allalso even the defendants themselves acknowledge that they almost feel bad for mcdonalds for being so singled out in the trial for as they say mcdonalds isnt the only business thats having a negative impact on the world theyre just the only one that tried to sue them for libeloverall though the audience will find themselves cheering for the two unlikely heros steel and morris as they plough through hardships in their personal lives and make a firm stand against almost insurmountable odds in a case that ends up breaking the record for the longest trial in english history later they go on to trial with the english government itself which is a separate story altogetherthe dvd extras include a painfully exposing minutes of a secretly taped meeting with mcdonalds executives trying to settle out of court this minutes alone is enough to convince anyone that mcdonalds is not on the up and up that may seem like old news now but without such people as dave morris and helen steel it might not be
this is such a good dvd the setting is a large part of this you can just about taste and smell tuscany the relaxed friendship sting has with the musicians makes you feel you are hanging out with old friendsone of my favorite tracks utilises stings hallway where the acoustics are superb the colors are warm and intimate and the musicians play with sensitivity and emotionthe concert itself is outside in the simplest of settingscoloured lights reflecting off the wall and fairy lights strung across to subtly light the scenesthe musicianship is superb as sting has assembled the best musicians and reworked with them some of his older stuff we see a warmer relaxed mellow sting with a soothing resonant voicethe challenge the group has when sept has its impact is sensitively handled it is a pity that the singer who could have injected a positive middle eastern feel to the final concert decides he cant go on however we do see him doing desert rose with sting in the rehearsal concert which is shown in items through the documentaryyou can explore stings villa and see the documentary of how they made this concert and cd released at the time woven with the songs they put together you can also select the documentary and the concert separately either as a whole or by tracklist this is a thorough and thoughtful accomodation for listening in many ways over timea major triumph in a simple quality product ill choose to hang out with sting and friends again and again
im so excited that seasons and of saved by the bell are soon coming out on dvd i grew up watching these guys the greatest episode in the series history is from season in zack and slater compete for the heart of a new girl in school things get pretty competitive and zack and slater come to blows during a school dance at the max when mr belding tried to break up the fight they accidently knocked off a toupee he was wearing and it landed in a punch bowl i never get sick of watching that episode it is by far my favorite oneanother famous episode on this dvd set is where oil was discovered under the school and everyone dreams of riches however after an oil spill in which screech gets doused with crude oil zack and the gang have a change of heart and convince the school board not to drill the oil out its a cheesy but memorable episodethis dvd set is a steal at just
ginal hill has been died last year one of my very favorite erudite and literary british mystery writers his books not only have depth of characters but interlockingstories that blend seamlessly together aside from his joe sixsmith stories and uncommon thrillers under the name of patrick ruell pascoe and dalziel series stand out as one of the greatestduos of detective fiction their interactions and repartees sometime are reminiscent of laurel and hardy in a more cerebral waythis series is different in a major way from other british tv series based upon well known mystery writers such as agatha christie margery allingham dorothy l sayers and more recently elizabeth george that they are only loosely based on the hill books indeed otherwise each book will require three or four hours to capture all the drama but someone has very cleverly adapted them to minutes of concise tv shows some of the wonderful dialogue is lost but the spirit of the books shine througha word dalziel pronounced deel played a small role in one of the martin shaws gently series here he is a fullblown yorkshire pudding pascoe could be more animated and annoying though ellie is she portrays the liberated wifewoman very wellthe whole series is well worth your time

this flick is a potpourri of great trivia star robert forster made his mark in only to slip into bmovie abyss before being resurrectedand oscar nominated by quentin tarantino in costar robin riker would later play chris elliotts nemesis in the cult sitcom a the films perfunctory heavy dean jagger won an oscar for oclock oscar nominee for michael v gazzo is also on hand here sidney lassick who plays the diabolical pet store owner was in flew over the cuckoos john ford regular mike mazurki has a bit as a security guard sue lyon the original lolita has a bit as a tv reporter as for john sayles script its intelligent but its not as witty as it wants to be there are too many obvious gags like a decapitated sewer worker named ed norton or a hospital intercom paging a dr howard what i felt distinguished the film was lewis teagues direction teague really knows how to ratchet the scares and suspense the alligator looked realistically menacing and that compensates for a lot of the flat tongueincheek qualities of the film on a final note when are they going to release teagues shotinphilly vigilante flick with tom skerritt and michael sarrazin on dvd
there is so much to enjoy and appreciate in this japanese project on the life of khan that its easy to overlook its incomplete telling of the tale visually the picture often pops with life across the screen making me wish id had the opportunity to see it at the cinemathe action is filmed in the classic style brutal cinematic but with sweep and edited tightly almost to a fault neat tidy and too perfectwhile the film may put off some westerners looking more for a history channel treatment most fans of asian cinema will recognize and appreciate the styles associated with more familiar asian epics which for me is a marvelous way of telling this particular storyi understand there was to have been a second more complete version of the film or perhaps a separate project if so i look forward to seeing it and completing this set overall this is rather a remarkable way to spend a couple of hours
you remember the disney muscial classic aladdin remember how jafar was defeated by being sealed in his own magic lamp by aladdin and thrown into the desert by genie well as they say in every good film you cant keep a spectacular villain down as the title states jafar returns to agrabah to exact his revenge on aladdin and the others and resume his plans for complete domination over the landover the years i have heard many people complain about this film usually stating that it is inferior to the orginal movieprequel i say different although they could have done much better with the animation the rest of the film characters storyline and the music is just as potent as ever genie is hilarious despite robin williams not making his own return for the role the relationship between aladdin and jasmine remains strong and dramatic and what i found to be the most entertaining iago abandons jafar early on in the film and does his best to be a heroas for the songs every disney film has to have some right it wouldnt be disney otherwise we have nothing in the world as genie comes hom after travelling the planet but feeling a little lonely im lookin out for me as iago leaves jafar to go off on his own we cant forget about love as genie and iago campaign to bring aladdin and jasmine back together after a misunderstanding and the best of the lot youre only second rate which is jafars villain song finally they missed that in the first filmso can aladdin and co defeat jafar a second time or is that sorcerer turned mostpowerfulgenieofall going to get the best of them once and for all the heroes are going to have put out all the stops on this one let me tell you especially iago well what are you waiting for here is your chance take it and witness the return of jafar
to tell you right off the bat this is not a historically accurate medieval movie so if that is what you looking for i would not suggest this movie what this movie is though is a lot of fun it is medieval with a modern twist this movie is set in th century francelondon this movie is over all very well done the characters are great especially the character of geoffery chaucer though not very historically accurate in presentation he would still in his teenage years when this movie was set but he is deffinatly funny and quirky and unexpected the costumes in this movie though not historically accurate are a lot of funone of the only characters that irked me was rufus sewells character hes such a great actor especially in movie like dangerous beauty and cold confort farm but i dont think he was right for the role of the villian hes trying hard to be evil and mean the other character that irked me slightly was heath ledgers love interest shes far to stuck up and snobby for my taste i much prefered laura fraziers character she is more real to meover all i very much recommend this movie it is very funny and enjoyable
i have to watch this every halloween because it brings a smile to my face every time actually all the charlie brown specials have that effect on mei love how peaceful and mellow the scenery is this is from the s after all and how there are no parents or adults anywhere i mean linus spends the night all night by himself in a pumpkin patch and his parents are ok with that this movie still cracks me up today like charlie brown whos always down on his luck getting rocks instead of candy in his trick or treat bagsnoopy trying to get enthused about a slow song but ends up getting depressed insteadand lucys infamous psycheout with the footballlucy is bratty as always but also shows a softer side when she takes care of her brother freezing outside and charlie browns sister sally shows a change of character too always devoted and lovecrazy over linus she nonetheless has her limits and lets linus have it when he disappoints herthis movie is sweet and i like how linus believes the great pumpkin will only come for those who are i also liked his comeback when charlie brown told him he was ridiculous for believing in the great pumpkin linus counters by saying its no different than charlie brown believing in santa claus good one when i was a kid i remember not liking the part where snoopy acts as a ww pilot and i still dont really care for that part today either goes on too long however snoopy is and will always be my favorite character among charlie browns friends

i was pretty cynical about the whole bleach thing it is shonen jump and shonen jump doesnt really have a good reputation among hardcore anime fans however i watched through the most recent episode via fansubs and realized i liked it enough to acquire the dvdsfirst of all the current price is hard to beat you get the first episodes which unfortunately arent the best things really pick up in the next few boxsets but do serve as an important introduction to the series as far as the actual boxset goes this one is really nice unlike the crappy naruto uncut boxes i mean i love naruto and get those box sets but you dont look at those and say wowie what a welldesigned box the bleach box has fantastic little touches that fans appreciate and enjoy plus it includes a poster which is much more useful than those pointless books that come packaged with narutobleach is highly overrated simply due to its popularity but that doesnt mean it is a bad series sure i wish shows like elfin lied or magical shopping arcade abenobashi got the same kind of attention but ive never been one to throw out the baby with the bathwateri will say i find vizs use of instead of the fansubbers use of quite obnoxious but oh well it is to be expected
few gay themed love stories are as touching and moving as this one between martin a gay man and lucas a seemingly straight man whom he has fallen in love withmaybe it is the fact that martin is living with aids and realizes that time is precious or just that he goes after what he wants but he wastes no filling lucas in on the way he feels a feeling which at first lucas doesnt seem to sharebut the two become friends and as they do we begin to realize as does lucas that something more is developing something he never thought possibleor did he although he has a girlfriend lucas wonders as does the viewer if there isnt something missingmuch of the pleasure of this film is in the small touches as the story unfolds as we see lucas come to the realization that this new friendship is developing into something more meaningful from here the movie unfolds to its very moving and satisfying conclusionyou may find yourself wanting to watch this movie more than once especially when you see how it ends repeated viewings only seem to make the story more meaningfulthis movie is a story of coming out of being true to yourself and the tremendous power of love
i love this movie and i totally agree with the critics that it was the best movie of as powerful and brilliant as this movie is it is also extremely tragic in regards to all the terrible pain and suffering that cuban author reynaldo arenas had to endured only because he was gay and was dead set against the cuban government for his beliefs he was jailedridicule and tortured in the most inhume way this film is not easy to sit thru simply because of everything that mrarenas went thru in his life javier bardem who i had never heard of before this movie does and an excellent job in capturing arenas charecteristics and mannerisms as well he gave a remarkable performance and was nominated for an academy award as best actor but unfortunately did not win which i thought was very wrong but then again we all know how much politics and red tape are in the oscars evey year and the actor or actress that you think deserves the award ends up not winning it is also sad to see when arenas becomes infected with hiv and in end dies in his new york aparment alongside his lover played by olivier martinez one performance that i thought was wonderful although very short was that of actor johnny depp as the charamistic and flamboyant drag queen bon bon he was also just as good playing a stern and cold cuban government official who interrogates reynaldo arenas about his true feelings for the government the scene where johnny depps character is sitting down in a chair and looks at arenas and starts touching his penis until he gets an erection is quite intense although too short to really notice but you really do see him touching himself overall this movie is amazing and i highly recommended to anyone who cares to know about what really goes on in cuba when you are thrown in jail and tortured only because of your sexual orientation and your beliefs of free speech which ofcourse they are forbidden in cuba another good reason to see this great movie is because the whole cast is wonderful and they all do an amazing job with their roles if you care about excellence in acting this one is a must see
this movie is simply fantastic having not read the book i felt it was complete and very well done much better then any harry potter or lord of the ring movies i now plan on reading the book and enjoying the full narnia adventurefour siblings stumble into a fantasy world through a wardrobe cabinet where a evil witch a good lion santa clause and talking animals inhabit one child is taken by the witch while the other three journey through the land to find the great lion joining forces with the lion and his troupe they battle the evil witch and her army reunited the child live carefree as royalty for many years until they come across familar ground and find the wardrobe cabinet making their way back into their world back as the childern they were when they enteredim sure much like lord of the rings much has to be removed to keep the movie in a managable time frame but unlike the ending to the lotr trilogy they did seem to finish narnia very wellin lotr the hobbits return to the shire to find the evil wizard and they defeat him this is such a important piece of the story showing the strength and courage of friends and is left out by the directorif you enjoy the wizard of oz i would highly recommend narnia as a must have for anyones collection an instant family classic one to be enjoyed over and over again
i finally saw this at a theatre this weekend i love movies but hate theaters but i was in the middle of three days of eight and under fastpitch softball it was degrees at the nearly shadeless softball complex and the small town theater had matineacutee prices about midway through i got a headache but that could have been from the ounce slushy rather than the film considering this has been out for five weeks there was fairly large crowd in the theaterbasically it was an entertaining film if not as good as the first one it was really too long most of the cannibal scenes should have been cut as the film really dragged at this pointthe assembly of the film was horrible making the story hard to follow and failing to build up even a tiny bit of suspense but it works fine as a comedyknightleys character has less screen time than the original and her stuff is more silly than funny you could say the same for depp and bloom as there is more focus on the supporting cast a good thing in the cases of davy jones and the bubbling pair of black pearl crewmana bad thing otherwisewhile certainly better than recent cg megamovie like the unprecedented attendance is hard to understand these computer generated action sequences are getting very old and losing their effectiveness with seasoned viewers leagues under the did scarier stuff using rubber tentacles almost years ago and the cg scenery backgrounds are little better than the old painted backdrops
boy do people miss the point on this movie you cant present a movie like a broadway show everytime this has been attemped historically the results are bad most adaptions of famous shows are only ok at best some are awful the medium is totally different the demands are different the singing is different the acting style is different yes the shows usually are quotbetterquot in a sense thats how it was originally written as a stage play you have got to really change things to make a successful movieso how good an adaption is this very good indeed the story was changed to very effectively fit the medium madonna stretched herself unbelievably to do this role and i think she did very well you may quite validly prefer the stage version of evita i like both but its almost like apples and oranges as good as patti lupone and mandy patinkin were they would if they played it the same way anyway come off mannered and absurd in a movie context all the conventions of the stage would be laughable unless it was simply of course an actual filmed stage production on the other hand madonna and banderas are not nearly strong and polished enough for a stage most of the changes a few i dont understand make a lot of sense when you consider how a movie has to flowas for this movie not being deep or historical its a musical for petes sake not quotsaving private ryanquot i dont know enough about eva peron to really say but i dont see how you could present a real historical drama in a musical context i think the problem is people dont like or understand opera which this essentially is most of the great operas have ludicrous story lines also if you are going to go in knowing you quothatequot musicals quothatequot madonna then fine this is not to your taste banderas is not a polished singer but his rough edged singing is very appealing and effective in this contextthe cinematography costumes are outstanding and serve the story well only as the dying evita do i find madonna not very believable i think evita is thrilling its one of my favorite movies of recent yearsi love the show evita and i love this too but in a very different way
i have been watch simpsons for twelve years now this episode of the simpsons has a christmasy feel to it i dont know why i like the simpsons so much maybe its because i have been watching it since i was just a little boy i remember staying at my grandpas house on cold snowy christmas eve nights and watching christmas specials we have bought throughout the years this included because there always was something great about this episode of the simpsons it is a cherished christmas classicthat started the whole series which is now the longest running primetime series on earth this episode is heartwarming classic and highly amusing and i hope this series will keep on creating laughs for years to come
i dont know why i do this to myself i always try to challenge the editor or critic and go ahead and watch films knowing was just about as dismal as the editor had pointed out midway during this film it got so selfinvolved i had no idea what sort of logic the main character was basing his theories on the last scene was just the cake it is sad to see that so much money and resources were wasted on this film and by no means am i being sarcastic cage was horrid his reactions to every given situation was one of a sad dog denied a bite of oreo
the movie is basically about two numbskulls harry and lloyd lloyd is a limo driver and he picks up a woman that is going to aspencolorado they get to the airport and he sees her leave the suitcase that she had and he picks it up he takes it back to his apartment with him and convinces his friend harry to go on a crosscountry trip to give the suitcase back to her the moments that follow are insanely hilarousjim carrey had a token year that year he had a string of hits ace ventura the mask and this he has a solid knack for physical and verbal comedy he can do impressions really well and has showed that in his films jeff daniels probably a new comer to the comedy game because mainly he has done some really serious roles can make you laugh really hard with his stupid yet funny questions the farelly brothers are comedic brillance they have had made seriously funny movies over the past years that they have existed they are a wonderful pair of directors and i hope they make more this film was one of the best comedic movies i have ever seen it is so histarically funny i guarentee that you wont stop laughing
thanksgiving is not really something that is acknowledged and certainly not something that is celebrated in scotland but i watch this tv special every year in the run up to xmas just to get me in the mood the cartoon begins with the usual gag where lucy yanks the football away from chuck i guess hell never learn to distrust women ehbut his main grief in this one is the fact that all of his friends invite themselves over to his place for thanksgiving despite the fact hes going to his grandmothers for the celebration snoopy and woodstock work together and against each other to prepare a slapdash dinner including toast jelly beans and popcorn needless to say the rest of the peanuts gang are far from impressed with the menu though that doesnt stop peppermint patty putting the moves on chuckall this talk of food has made me hungryan episode from is america charlie is also featured in which the peanuts gang recreate the famous mayflower voyage and trials and perils of the passengers and crew as they make their way to the new world having never studied this in school i never knew what thanksgiving was about other than eating a turkey this episode details all the main parts of the story and is quite a history lessonits a natural companion piece to a charlie brown thanksgiving as is obvious by its inclusion on the dvd but for all of you nonamerican people who dont fully understand the holiday perhaps you should watch this firsti dont get why the starving passengers didnt just eat woodstock thougha selfcongratulatory minute documentary is also included
i too feel something may have been in with this one not literally but culturally and without a contemporary context i mean i thoroughly enjoyed it and i am incredibly grateful to finally get to see this film and in such great condition and with a bunch of extras however i found myself losing patience andor just not relating to the handwringing morality and significance of a large part of this i will say though that once they arrive on the island it was almost like a nightmarish adult version of willy wonka with wideeyed agape visitors being led through this sort of amusement parkmonument of atrocities by a gleeful loonie who thinks its all wonderful i also felt that the emotional overreacting was mostly reserved for the more tragedies and once these characters are facetoface with truly awful things they just walk around and take it all in for the most part and then theres the dreaded onecharacterexplainsitallforyou in the final act i guess i wish the whole thing had been pitched throughout consistently nightmarish and devoid of logic this wouldnt have harmed the film i think all this aside though its unlike any movie youll ever see and most of the visuals are absolutely mindblowing in a he just way and amid all the performance artist gyrations there are moments of truly awesome acting great use of sounds as well and i love how the contemporary directorsfans have no problem describing their enjoyment of the film as laughing out loud at the absurdity of much of it that i could totally relate to
this is a documentary or rockumentary if you will about the ramones the story of the ramones is told through interviews with the group and their associates they even found and interviewed the elusive richie ramone the movie does a good job of telling the story of the ramones warts and all but at under two hours some of the events in the bands year history had to be glossed over such as the fiasco but that event is covered in a deleted scene in the bonus material this is a fair and balanced account of the history of the ramones rest in peace joey dee dee and johnny
ive always said in my personal meetings with coleagues and friends that pacino is much more than an actor hes a nature force but back to serpico this movie not only remains as cult movie and one of the works of this tireless film maker as sidney lumet was in that age serpico meant a breakthrough with the ancient patterns of good citizen and virtuosi copserpico is a simple inmigrant citizen who lives in a little department he brings in his mind the ancestral illusions for being part of the american dream his inner sense of justice is not influenced for any other kind of ideology in this sense hes naif suddenly hes inmersed in a double face world the eternal game of make the things appear right though they are rotten really his search for the sense of justice prevails and becomes nowadays in a kind of romantic knight but he besides the prize he must pay for his behavior goes ahead no matter what dont forget that in times of hipocrisy any sincerity is associated with cynismthis film is part of the amazing sextet together with twelve angry men the pawnbroker the offence network and equus that in my opinion express the most remarkable works of that extraordinary film maker
d the show for all seasons very few shows do i set my dvr for and must wacth it house was one sad to see it end it could have easily went on another season or the finale i wish it was a hour event it deserved it but atleast they did show that retrospective special right before iti really kinda wanted house to really be dead as we thought he was for a few seconds i thought who but house would have the balls to kill off the main character and end the series seems every ending to a series these days they always leave a door open for a comeback special or somethingoh well wilson will be dead if they do unless they drove their bikes down to mexico and got some unorthodox remedy there who knows with tv
i finally completed my basil rathbone collection of sherlock holmes movies with this purchase i had a copy on dvd of pursuit to algiers made from tcmtv and had the other on vhs i was very happy of the quality on dressed to kill woman in green andterror by night as the vhs copy were from a public domain producer and the dvds were so much better and of course i love to watch all of these movies and will many times over i can recommend all of these movies both for their print copy and for the content i always believed that basil rathbone was very talented actor and all of the others are also stories typical sherlock holmes and for any new fan they will find them very fun to watch
i first saw bob saget on tv when he did an one night many years ago and he was brilliant absolutely hysterical made me lose my breath laughing when i saw him hosting the home show i thought he was cute somewhat dear but still funny in a groaning badpunbutgoodeffort sort of waythen came this travesty i understand that he was trying to be different to shed the old familyman image but he just wasnt funny in this i dont mind obscenities but these just basically seemed gratuitous he could have just stood there and strung together all the dirty words that came to mind and gotten the same effecti keep wishing hbo would release those old night shows on dvd especially bob sagets i keep wishing and never more so than now
this film is an exceptional film wiht an ensemble cast gregory peck is the standout but the rest of the cast are what really make this a film to remember dean jagger as a recalled wwi veteran is exceptional as the adjutant a nonflier now but one who has been there his oscar is well deserved gary merrill and millard mitchell are also well cast and play their roles well this film shows military leadership at its most influential getting me to do what they ordinarily wouldnt and then keep on going back for more it isnt preachy like command decision but rather gives a your are therequot feeling i highly recommend this film to everyone
this is my third review tanking this film without it being published so i will try to find a more appropriate way to write about this messi played it in the store for several go arounds and the feedback has been universal in how the tedious and boring subplots underwhelm an attempt at creating an american hero in cubas paramilitarysecret squirrel character the artwork is deceiving as this is not a military action film and the few surviving were corny and funny enough looked unrehearsedaside form the four different time lines being intertwined into a story the plot involves us government higherups coordinating an operation to kill the of not saddam but osama whilst really hiding their motives in some convoluted conspiracy as cuba tries to uncover the plot he manages to listen to pointless characters talk for hours on end about their war philosophy jk simmons does manage to spout some fun lines on war and such but his scenes are forced and the gun they gave him was way too heavy for him he is always fun to watch thoughcustomers have repeatedly gotten bored with it and general feedback has been average to below average as a film and with that lame ending one feels a loss at having watched this maybe next time
this movie impressed me in such a negative way i feel thati must write a review i have certainly noticed that about outof reviews ive seen are quite positive movies are very powerfuland evocative and what rankles me no end is that crass movies likethis play on cheap emotions and sympathies about how we are allvictims how life is so unfair and thus we must feel compassion forthe less fortunate who martyr themselves for among other things matter how outrageous their actions arethere was a movie that came out some years ago about a millionairewho offers a desperate couple a million dollars if he can have an affairwith the wife the promoters of the movie were able to create a smallstir really a bunch of gossip should they or shouldnt they acceptthe offer fortunately i never saw the movie because the idea struck meas nonsense the bait of money that supposedly wants etcand just like the other movie mentioned above i see that has also caused a stir among professional and nonprofessionalreviewers is the love of the lead character bess so pure that shebecomes a mary magdalenelike prostitute to satisfy the ofher paralyzed husband and thus as she believes keeps him alive or isshe so innocent because she is somewhat feebleminded and thus of the hypocritical church elders incl her grandfather whopredictably excommunicate her which results in her being cast out byher own family and hastens her demisethe handling of these issues in the is triteunbelievable and as i wrote above the movie very disingenuously and withamazingly exaggerated selfimportance plays on human sympathies aboutsocalled one of the biggest problems with the movie that contributesto its negative effect is that almost the entire footage is done with closeupsthe constant closeups are annoying on tv on the big scene i can only imaginewhat the effect would have been the constant closeups force a reaction sceneafter scene for almost the entire hoursthe first hour of the movie like many european movies really drags fora viewer accustomed to american movies while sometimes the slower pace createsa richness of plot and character development here it only underscores the weakthemes and characterizations in the movie and foreshadows later events that areeasily predicted the final travesty is the quick wrapup at the end whenbess supposedly herself it is so contrived i was aghast when i sawthe scene and then with no explanation at all her husband is suddenly healedand then we are expected to believe that she goes to heaven and bells above the oil rig where he works a real tragedy of the is that some very fine performancesare almost totally wasted the actors who play besss sisterinlaw and theyoung concerned doctor are believable and touching and show the kind ofpotential the movie might have realized had it not been so contrived excessiveand poorly written for the lead character who herself gives a performancethat is also excessive and selfindulgent
if you know nothing of judith miller valerie plame wilson and scooter libby the movie is a great flick the acting is all top notch if on the other hand you read the newspapers watch the news have read or know anything about the truth around which this fiction is built the storyline is quite distracting because you keep comparing reality to fiction and back again inspite of my familiarity though i did enjoy the movie the characters are compelling plus there are enough fictional surprises that it becomes easier to forget about the reality as the movie progresses i would absolutely not recommend the movie to my politico friends but for anyone who could care less about political news the movie is first rate
beautiful mind tries to do the selfcontradictory by presenting a slick hollywoodish story about the obscure and diabolical world of schizophrenia that it is based on the life of a real person the mathematician john nash doesnt add much psychological credibility to the film again and again some directors or technicians device eg nash scrawling hieroglyphic equations on the princeton library window or having scattered letters from a magazine take on a glowing life to show how nash perceives them as a code gives us the feeling that were being taken on a disney world ride through the mysteries of the mindnevertheless the film is quite watchable for about twothirds of its length after the dull exposition that sets up the central events and before the mawkish conclusion credit goes primarily to the stars russell crowe and jennifer connollycrowe despite his status as the hunk du jour clearly has satisfying acting technique and apparently good instincts whatever reservations i have its fair to say that he brings the nash character to compelling life if only he didnt push the awkwardloner vulnerablebrainbox motif so far i suspect that ron howard the director instead of shaping the performance and asking for more subtlety at key moments kept urging crowe to pull out all the stopsim not suggesting that he indulges in scenery chewing mostly he keeps his technique within reasonable bounds and some of the time it serves us well but in spite of his stardom crowe doesnt yet have the confidence to hold back where some reticence would actually strengthen the role when if he trusts himself and his audience more hes going to be an actor to reckon withjennifer connolly is luminous id never seen her before and she gives her role depths and corners where the script gives her colorless outlines shes strikingly beautiful but doesnt coast on her looks and provides most of the movies genuinely touching momentsthe films only other actor of note is the egregious ed harris who gives us the umpteenth version of his snakeeyed glare and growling line readings its a mystery to me why so many people think hes a great actor screen presence sure range from x to x prime as nash might put itgood cinematography helps featuring warm interiors that reveal the polished allure of the halls old woodwork and exteriors that capture the sharpfocus chill of autumn and the sturdy solidity of venerable buildings on the campuses of princeton and mit the musical score one of the movies few understated directorial elements is effective toothe widescreen dvd transfer is firstclass something you cant count on in dvds with none of the background pumping and motion jerkiness that can result when the compression necesary to fit a movie onto a small silver disc is performed poorlya beautiful mind has its rewards too bad they come only in patches

i rented this movie because my threeyearold nephew has a fascination with suits of armor but i came away a fan myself henry wilcoxin makes a great richard a young richard who only goes on crusade to evade one arranged marriage and then enters into another only to gain cattle for his band of soldiers the movie concerns how richard slowly comes to respect marriage and to understand quotthe true meaningquot of the crusades but only at the ultimate cost for his pride and his heart of course i think anyone would come to respect marriage pretty darn quick if they learned the lady in question was loretta young resplendent in her blond wig she turns in an undated performance as a woman who loves one man but appreciates another in this case a sexy saracen who knows how to compliiment women one of my other favorite characters was the hermit aka the holy man played by caubrey smith i especially liked his staff which has a rather unique crucifix carved into it the hermit is probably the bravest character in the movie defying the saracens even though it eventually costs him his life and of course then there are the lusty battle scenes replete with boiling oil and flaming catapults so if you want to watch an excellent old spectacle you wont be sorry to go on this quotcrusadequot with wilcoxin and young
this is not a movie i will strongly reccomend you to watch but if you are a jim carrey fan you may love this movie but the movie runs about and a half hours and i feel that this is one of the movies books music etc that doesnt dervse stars but stars but if you like to watch movies about hours and mintues i also reccomend harry potter and the sorcerers stone as the movie opens peter appleton jim carrey is a movie writer until he gets into a car crash and doesnt remember anything when he wakes up he goes to a town and is mistaken for luke trimble who has been missing for a long time of course if mistaken is the right word matt damon in an uncredited role voices luke trimble only once in this movie there are two things i feel that are important to know before you wach a movie for the first time one is to know how long the movie runs and two know what the movie is rated this movie got a pg rating so i will leave it up to you if you want to let your kidsteenagers watching this like i said earlier i give this movie a lukewarm recomention
im a big fan of this wonderfully acted and written show however season five was a big disappointment the shorten season due to sarahs pregnancy never really got going anywhere it is as if the writers did not want to start anything because they could not finish it in the eight epidsodes allowedalso the girls were different in this season as they had to be each had life changing moments in season that could not really be played out in season five samatha heartbroken from richard is more subdued than normal miranda is adjusting to life as a mom carrie is recovering from her second break up with aiden only charolette seems to be moving forward in her life thanks to her divorce attorney it would have been nice to have had a season for season five so that we could have a continuation of the story linesalso the issue with the price tag on this set is a pressing one only eight episodes is going to call for only two discs they should not be more than bucks at the most well see how well sales do with the price tag is does have i think it would have been better for hbo to have released this set with season sixoverall i have truly enjoyed this series and will miss it when it is gone thank god for my dvd collection
i received pawn as an amazon vine reviewer and just watched it last nightan action thriller that keeps you guessing all the way through its got a lot to like for those who enjoy the genre as i do great acting by some well known and notso well known actors with stories interwoven in such a way that it holds your interest the entire way throughgood cops bad cops reformed thugs and in the moment predators all collide at an allnight diner theres no doubt its going to get bloody but whats it really all for just a quick hold up for jewelry and cash nah theres more at stake than that and the innocents caught in the middle struggle to understand and surviveid recommend this film based upon michael chiklis irish accent alone maybe it was english whatever liked it ray liotta is basically good fellas gone gray but hey its ray forest whitaker did a great job in his small role and the supporting cast was outstandingthis isnt one youll want to get up and get popcorn in the middle of as youll miss it for surenicely crafted and while violent enjoyably so if you dont mind bad being true to itself watch pawn and see how checkmate really happens
i was introduced to michael powells work by a friend who loved the red shoes although i dislike musicals that film had such visual poetry that i loved it the instant i saw iti have made it a point to see his other films wherever possible and stairway to heaven seen several times on tv was always a favorite oddly it has never been available in any video formatuntil nowthis double feature has a pristine print of stairway which remains a favorite and a film everyone should seeaccompanying it is powells final filmage of consent which i had never before seen it features a fine measured performance by james masonand a firsttime showing by helen mirrenviewing these and powells other films show just how good this man was i find it amazing that one filmpeeping tom derailed his career so completelyin any case this is a great dvd with two amazing filmsand when you see them you will seek out his other works
creepy music and eerie imaginative sets make this a classic look for the bizarre patterns on the floor and on the walls in the insane asylum even minutes into the film these strange surroundings have the power to impressvery slow at the beginning but speeds up towards the end best collection of hats in any film ive seen even better than in the film favorite setting was the city clerk office with those odd high chairs title cards are agonizingly slow you can read each one out loud times or to yourself times one of them i needed to and only after the readings did look like and not isnt it technically possible to remove all the title cards and put that same text on the film as subtitling i am sure the filmmakers would approve of that change and would have done it themselves if they could havethe ending is famous but i didnt quite catch it as i was also reading the newspaper having become frustrated at the eversoslow pacing and only figured it all out after reading the excellent wikipedia article on the film
i dont think young children under the age of would sit and enjoy this movie i certainly enjoyed it but the previews make it look like it is a fantasy like movie sorta like labrynth but they will be let down although this is a good story the previews are misleading i know i will get comments on this but its the truth awesome storyline but again probably not good for young children to sit and enjoy kind of like spiderman for little childrenit is great but i think kids would rather see spidey the whole two hours and a half in costume swinging around and the rest of the adults enjoying the storylin
i bought and watched it yest i have a d tv but dont like watching d movies when they have black bars on the top and bottom so i just watched it in d i turned up my and sat backand i must say they really did a good job at this movie very bloody and the special effects where done very welland the soundtrack sounded more then amazing thru surround sound ill be watching it a few more times thats for sure only thing was when i watched it in d the picture in some parts where very grainyi never had that problem before with a new bluray movie i even played with my settings and had no luck but other then alittle grainyness this movie is deff a keep
on earth happened is a question that surrounds this film it had all the makings of a classic modern epic akin to and the but somewhere most likely the editing room the film dramatically lost its waythere are no subplots no romances the battle scenes are so hastily edited its near impossible to know whats going on it also makes the battles boring and lacking in blood and gore and thats the reason i wanted to see the movie the supposedly terrifying bad guys are also nonexistent they have been replaced by a bunch of bear skins on horses the best acting the film has to offer is given by every actor who has to pretend these things are scary give them all an oscaromar sharif and diane venora are criminally underused together they have about minutes of screen time the film is stocked with giant viking warriors who are actually nice funny and interesting characters its a real shame that the film wastes these characters by never letting them develop or have a moment to shineall in all the film is an ok way to kill an hour and a half i just expected a lot more from the director who gave us and the writer who gave us
n orphaned boy fang shijie jay chou of the golden grows up to be a student of a kung fu school shijie eventually leaves the school however after getting involved with a brawl and meeting a smalltime downandout hustler wang li eric tsang trilogy who discovers the young shijies talent as basketball player this is how the story of fu fu which unashamedly borrows the concept of fu is in fact a hodgepodge of halfbaked ideas that sit uncomfortably together director yenping chu throws in many jokes and actions disregarding the storyline or any logics ok this is his style right but the jokes and actions are just unfunny and unexcitingfor all you can see is those basketball players including chen bolin and baron chen passing and shooting helped by wire stunts four teachers of kung fu school arrive and are allowed to join the which means doing kung fu fighting in the basketball court apparently one master taught his pupil how to the time and rewind it something christopher reeves superman did many years ago and dont forget the subplot about the parentage of fu asks us to embrace its chaos and enjoy it i like chaotic comedy could be anything from marx to or zucker abrahams and zucker but this chaos is not just hilarious stephen chow successfully incorporated kung fu into soccer to great comedic effect however the kung fu elements kicking punching etc have no place in the plot or the basketball court of fu director gives it a try anyway not knowing how to use the sports factors in comedy and action the result is just a mess jay chou who was much better in of the golden looks terribly bored and so do chen bolin and baron chen as to charlene choi her job seems to stand and smile before the camera and nothing moreat the time of writing some sources including internet site imdb cite the name of japanese manga creator takehiko inoue known for his as the basis of the film fu might have been inspired by the story of this hugely popular comic but the fact is the films story or characters have nothing to do with the manga as far as i remember i couldnt find the name of inoue in the credits
if you are expecting this to be a simple spy vs spy plot forget about it oh yes it has spies galore but this hilarious sendup of all things must have inspired comedic authors galore every time i watch it i catch another sly pun or comment that cracks me up this movie is very clever and every actor is hilarious in this allstar cast from david niven as the original retired james bond to his wily and troublesome nephew jimmy bond played to perfection by woody allen deborah kerr plays mimi villainess turned nun for her love of sir james me jamey peter sellers has fun with many costume changes but does not play the bumbler rather he is an expert in bacarat standing in for to help beat one of the bad guys played hilariously by orson wells and assisted by the fabulously beaded and feathered ursula andress the sets are those of dreams and nightmares with plenty of the mod patterns of the s when this movie was produced if you love off the wall comedy this one is a keeper but watch it closely the jokes range from subtle and dry to outright silly puns and the confusion created is deliberate and fun watch for cameos by peter otoole humphrey bogart and many more
this movie is so inventive that youll wonder how screenwriter charlie kaufman thought of the concept refreshingly modern hip giddy funny innovative and bursting with originality you wont find any creative block here the plot is nearly indescribable it has something to do with a portal at floor that leads into the mind of actor john malkovich for minutes and then dumps you on the new jersey turnpike sound weird it is but the plot is beside the point it is thoroughly original hilarious and extremely and entertaining john cusack is great as the pathetic pupeteer and cameron diaz shows she can take good career risks with this unusual role for her but it is catherine keener and john malkovich who give the film iss flavor keener is the ultimate object of desire for everyone in the film and she delivers very funny lines and gives the best performance in the cast john malkovich is also very funny playing himself showing us that you can deliver a good performance even if youre playing an actor named john malkovich great movie one of the best of see it from a scale of i give this movie a
based on ron hansensthe assassination of jesse james by the coward robert fordand written and directed by the new zealander director andrew dominik two nominations for the academy awards and a prize in venice i feel very sorry for the reviewers here who found this motion picture long and boring they just chose the wrong movie for their saturday night and they still have a long way to go to appreciate films as an art manifestation as for the film itself its undoubtedly a masterpiece i liked the way the director described life in the west then and also the strange relation that related jesse james and robert ford if you are curious take the time to see how another great director samuel fuller handled the same theme in in i shot jesse jameseclipse series the first films of samuel fuller the baron of arizona i shot jesse james the steel helmet criterion collection youll be surprised how fullers sensibility announces robert fords portrayal by andrew dominik a dvd zone your library
it takes a certain kind of brave and twisted person to turn his life and body into an s m performance piece bob flanagan is both sick and brilliant flanagan survived cystic fibrosis until the age of fortytwo a very long time he attributes this to constantly inflicting pain on himself relentlessly over the years his dominatrix partner sheree helps him with is goals the various scenes are sometimes spliced with dark humor and other times simply shown in their bleak gruesomeness there is nothing that bob and sheree have not done to him to inflict pain in the most disgusting ways possible its an entirely different world and it takes a strong stomach to watch bob specializes in abusing his penis in ways unimaginable including a scene with a hammer a nail and a board there is blood the most amazing part of this documentary is when bob and sheree take this art to various museums in new york and los angeles bob allows himself to be raised by his feet pierced shackled and naked high above the museum goers heads it is disturbing if you have an interest in the s mbondage world you might find this interesting but the scenes are so graphic and sometimes overwhelming in their intensity it can be hard to stomach this is a perplexing film

my friends raved to me about a movie they had seen over the weekend it was this movie was napoleon dynamite i went to amazoncom to check the sales rank and reviews to discover there were few bad reviews so i thought i would give it a shot the next weekend i watched the movie with a friend we both sat quietly watching the plotless film it looked as if it had potential in the beginning so we waited and waited for the plot to develop only to discover there wasnt one there is a reason the character napoleon dynamite doesnt get recognized in every day life because they are compulsive liars to make their boring lives seem worthwhile this movie is a complete waste of time and i have no idea why so many people have actually purchased it save your money
simply put sucksits not scary there is no is totally ineffective in its attempt to be a horror movie and basically what you end up with is a boring piece of crap i must say that this is one of the worst movies ive seen in quite some time is terrible and nothing more needs to be said other than do not watch this garbage if you are a serious horror movie fan or you will sorely regret it sucksperiod i cant believe i wasted my money on this trash it takes more than human beings with fishlike physical characteristics to make a good horror movie i cant believe that people defend this movie if it is science fiction you are looking for maybe this is for you but if you are looking for a horror movie and you are serious about the genre then you will abhor this fish excrement
i liked this movie i liked it more than the previous movies but then thats just methe premise of this movie is the fall out it tracks what normally happens when top secret programs suddenly become public in the movies the agencies seek to protect what they can and burn the rest so this follows that premise if you are looking for the more detailed plots that the previous movies had its not in this moviethis movie is the establishment of the new character aaron cross and following his journey through the burn being that they plan on continuing the story line you know the new character is going to surviveif you enjoy jeremy renner you will most likely like this movie if you really liked the previous movies you will either love or hate this movie but only you can make that choice
my son chose this movie for family movie night and i groaned when i saw that it is hours minutes long to my surprise it did have an interesting story although it tried to be so dramatic for every second of that hours that i found myself wishing upon a star for some comedic reliefor any kind of relief the suspenseful music was consistent through the entire movie so it lost its ability to create suspense after a while we became immune from it another great surprise was thandie newton gleefully playing her role of evil temptress and cheerful hostess to the hilt loved that character there were some very creative creatures here too this was not a bad movie and would make a good rental
this is a documentary about germanys attempt to place many of their weapons manufacturing plants underground later in the war as the allies relentlessly bombed their cities and armament operations it was a last ditch attempt to pull out victory from what was becoming certain defeat it is also the story of the degree to which hitler would go to grasp for victory humans were nothing more than disposable tools like worn out saw blades or broken down vehicles in the building of these amazing underground facilities thousands of lives many of them were pows were lost in this effort after being closed to the public for many decades they have been reopened to show the world there always is the question of what if they had succeeded in building plants that were safe from the allies bombs we will never know a more pertinent question today might be where could this be going on in the world with rogue nations building secret weapons or other potentially lethal or illegal operations even our country has deep underground facilities connected with the military and critical defense operations a fascinating world to think about and explore this film is a beginning and very interesting although it could have been pared down to a shorter version but nevertheless a worthwhile venture
i havent seen too many of the films that john wayne has been in besides this and true grit i know ive seen about a handful of others but i cant remember the names of them the cowboys is a film that ive viewed a few times and enjoyits quite entertaining the entire cast does well in their roles the plot is cohesive with no loose ends i am a bit surprised with some of the films scenes though the cowboys is quite gritty in places i dont know if i can consider this to be a familyoriented movie one of the things i cant figure out is why the parents would let their kids go out on a job that was so dangerous the cowboys is a satisfactory film that i dont mind seeing every once in a while worth a watch
joe tony curtis and jerry jack lemmon are two musicians from chicago that witness st valentines day massacre which the mob is fully aware of the two musicians must skip town to save their lives and they decide to join a female band that is going to florida this is where josephine tony curtis and daphne jack lemmon appear on the train ride to florida they both meet sugar kane kowalczyk marilyn monroe who they both find immensely attractive but their situation does not allow them to openly express their feelings for her some like it hot is an interesting film because it flirts with issues of homosexuality but also gender identity the structure of the film conceals these issues in a clever manner since it would probably not be very politically correct to address these issues in when homosexuality was considered a mental illness by doctors and mental health professionals the film is a brilliant comedy that offers many laughs and also pondering for those who need contemplative meditation
tete en friche meaning something like aka my afternoons with margueritte minutes was hailed as depardieus finest performance in years while i argue that depardieu is always good he does add a touch of magic in this role a magic that he usually does not performdepardieu plays germaine chazes a gardener and produce vendor who likes to spend time off drinking with his weird friends and playing darts since depardieu is as huge as ever here he lends a cheerful rolypoly quality to this character of simpleminded germaine who suffered in school for lack of an ability to read welltherefore he seems to be semiliterate but he isnt i cant fathom how he has this ravishing young girlfriend who really loves him but i think that is beside the point one day germaine befriends yearold margueritte van de veld a delightful gisele casadesus a retired world health organization doctor and literati of the highest order she begins reading to germaine who revels in marguerittes reading rather than accept a book she offers himand yes before the screaming begins in the film she addresses the reason her name is spelled with two tsthere is a delight in watching the friendship blossom but this is noharold and maudeso i deplore any such comparisons germaine says he loves margueritte of course she has become like a grandmother to him all he has aside from a nearly underage girlfriend is a crazy nasty old mother so he is lonesome in a deeply profound way which he shares with margueritte she replies that it is a terrible thing she understands himthis is a fine film but i think the end was contrived and spun out of control i leave that for you to discover since i do not wish to spoil this entirely i love these types of film and this as french cinema is light years ahead of the usual gallic beatthedeadhorse approachit is valuable and just might become a perennial favorite as films go that is if you can bear to see the shape depardieu has gotten to
this is not a war by miles and miles it is first and foremost a distinctly french movie with its prime goal being to make modern frenchmen feel guilty about not treating colonial muslim troops better during wwii sure thats an issue to be addressed but then again minority troops in every army of wwii were treated as second class soldiers regardless of whom they were fighting for thats the way it always has been and always will bethe movie itself is okay not great but worth having if you can get it discounted because the uniforms and equipment used in the flick is top notch they use a mixture of correct lebel rifles enfield ps and even a few m garands and mix castoff american french and british uniforms and equipment which is precisely what the rd algerian division wore and used i was greatly bummed at the beginning of the flick when they were using modern military trucks and a vietnam era m jeep for vehicles but those vanished when they changed filming locations laterthere are only two battle scenes in this movie both of which are extremely weak when compared to private ryan flags of our fathers letters from iwo enemy at the gates etc the rd algerian only participated in a couple of relatively minor battles one in italy and in the recapture of alsace in and in neither case did the algerian troops perform well this is somewhat illustrated in the alsace version of their fight but only because they are seemingly overwhelmed that was not the historical case they simply were poorly trained and being under french command their natural instincts were to surrender or retreat anyway its a decent movie but it has a lot more social commentary in it than war movie and its kinda dopey in spots because of the french film making some of its just kinda dumb like when the screen says theyre in the ruhr valley and theyre filmed hiking through ominous looking mountains well duhand when is someone going to make a movie about the hundreds of thousands of frenchmen who volunteered to serve in the wehrmacht and waffen ss during wwii these men far outnumbered the often touted french resistance yet the story of the charlemagne division of the third reich and the other french troops who wore the german helmet is brushed under the rug today lets see an epic about that im not holding my breath thoughadd it to your military video collection just dont look for this one to be anything near private ryan stalingrad or any of the true epics out there for my money and is still the best unsung movie about wwii that never got the praise or rewards it deserved and it was done on a budget of under million

the hunt is a danish film about a teacher falsely accused of molesting one of his pupils by the young girl herself with no proof except that of the girls word he finds himself condemned by those around himits an interesting story that is well told and the paranoia associated with sex offenders is readily apparent at times the film is moving and at others it makes you angry at the unfairness of it all the lead character is very well played by the same actor who plays hannibal in the new tv series you feel for him as his world crumbles around him and those that were once his friends now treat him as a pariahthe rest of the cast also do a superb job with their roles especially the young girl the film is made more effective by the understated nature it feels authentic and when certain events occur they really do come as a shockthis is an excellent film about a tricky subject highly recommended
cubitt and feore performances lend significant depth to the otherwise stale plot of the movie these actors abilities to show the complexity of their characters and vividly portray their drastically different lives add tremendous breath to the storyafter the death of their father the younger brother uncovers the facade of his older brother as the perfect son this revelation helps the two reconnect despite emotional barriers they have erected in time the irresponsible selfdestructive younger brother becomes a pillar in their relationshipi believe this movie makes a significant contribution to the plethora of movies produced in the same vain it stands out for the love portrayed between two brothers as they connect as a family defining the meaning of brotherly love
i dont know why people do reviews on items they dont own if youve seen the theatrical version how can you rate this one its the directors cutmoving on this ones certainly not for the kiddies as it has nudity bad language and ultraviolence even still im surprised that it was such a quality production the story character designs and animation all are done eloquently and the soundtrack rocks i understand that the theatrical version has the sex scenes edited out so that may be the way to go for some of you but this unadulterated cut is what the anime industry needs after seeing so much cookiecutter formulaic anime titles stars all the way cant wait for the next part of this sad but thrilling title
get ready for a much more serious film on drug addiction if your goin for the notsoserious movie check out spun or trainspotting the message delivered in this film is quite powerfulto say so the least the war on drugs is such a controversial topic and this movie explored many sides of it in one scenario it ruins a family only to bring them all together in the end in another scenario another family is destroyed and in the end their family is muddled with lies and even more destruction and in similar two other scenarios one friend looses another due to the nastiness of the drug business where you are subject to everything especially murderwhy four stars instead of five too many plots thrown together for one thing you have to see this movie a good times to fully understand and get what is going on with everyone and their own separate scenarios another thing i find confusing is the overall general message this film is trying to saywhat is it or is there no general message just that the war on drugs is quite complex and quite intricate therefore there are both good and bad aspects if so i already knew thati do believe everyone should see this movie however it gives interesting thought to a very complex issue that i am sure everyone has an opinion on
being from disney you couldnt expect to much at least they put a stop to the musical portion but giving a person bm isnt bad enough you give us some screen till he steals the balloon and escapes the on coming tornado which like the original takes him to oz where a witch thinks hes the prophesied wizard the back ground was too disney like animated color unlike avatar which was unique and truly amazing oz was a cartoon as well as some of the similarities between this and the original i did hope for better but settled for this
sliding right from a short run if that in theatres to dvd the excellent the electric is the quintessential film based on the james lee burke novel the electric mist with confederate the movie finds burkes cajun detective dave robicheaux once again hot on the trail of a brutal killer in addition to dealing with the current killing of a young prostitute robicheaux must address troubling memories of a murder he witnessed more than years ago as a boy throw in for good measure his daily grapple with alcoholism and bizarre visions of conversations with civil war confederate general john bell hood who at best gives convoluted advice robicheaux and the viewer must decide if general hoods presence in his life is represented by simple reveries brought on by alcohol or a very real manifestation of the dead coming back to life in order to right a wrong the latter assertion seems feasable when one considers the mystical ethic of rural louisiana where the story unfolds focus on the last scene of the film for corroboration tommy lee jones is brilliant as the troubled flawed yet highly effective robicheaux one cant think of a better choice of actor filmed rather beautifully on location director tavernier brings the requisite atmosphere to the table
josh grobans disc from is a good package amore per starry starry and joy of mans were all released in studio versions on his first selftitled cd was released on both and would also find live performances on his live greek set so there isnt a startling difference in repertoire on this disc except for the john williams composition and grobans exceptional version of holy joshs voice is lovely and well suited to the material he and david foster have selected the dvd shows him in performance on angie stone pinch hits for charlotte church his live versions are so polished that they are almost studio versions in front of a live audience the audience is so respectful that it plays well on the dvd and rarely intrudes on the audio disc the cd the dvd are a handsome package that is well worth it for his devoted fans enjoy
it is a shame that elitists stick together so well it is because of their superior pride they lift up the work of their comrades when artistic value is lacking lost in translation is a movie that should have been a lost screenplay this movie is boring stagnant and just another sophisticated comedy created to help people with insomnia get some much needed restbill murray has a few bright moments in this movie and there are but a few most of this movie is comparable to watching real on mtv only even more of a disaster so much wasted film so much wasted timescarlett johansson is just a pretty face and she had no business sharing the silverscreen with bill murray her acting consisted of widening her eyes and stretching out on the bed or window seal not much talent needed in this disaster of a comedy drama or whatever it was supposed to be i will check the cast of every movie i rent to make sure i never suffer through her work againbottom line this movie is definitely a sleeper though ill give you that please try acting or something peaceout god bless
that collection of videoclips is essential to really capture the importance of michael jackson in pop culture today his heritage in a way he invented the video clip they say with and it is true his accomplice landis made a tremendous jewel of this song and theme it is great music it is great dancing and it is great pictures filming shooting cinema most of the other clips on that dvd are good and some are fascinating we will probably quote some still in fifty years when we are on mars though he would have preferred the moon where he could have practiced his moon walkingdr jacques coulardeau university paris pantheon sorbonne university paris saint denis university paris creacuteteil cegid
s a general rule i dont watch movies that center around food because i end up getting too hungry but i watched this one because ive always been a huge fan of brittany murphy ever since i first saw her in the torkelsons when that show ended i knew we would be seeing a lot of her and thank god we did ill always miss her and i have loved every movie shes been in even the ones with difficult story lines this movie moved me a lot more than i expected it would and she is definitely at the top of her game in this role watching this made me want to go to tokyo for real ramen it looks so good
y intelligent thoughtful retelling of the true story of six menwho where put away in the uk for a bombing in ireland they had nothingto do with and how journalists finally got the case reexaminedthis reminded me in tone of a low budget all the presidents men thefocus being not on the men imprisoned nor the real culprits but onthe slow difficult uphill climb journalists faced in putting togetherthe facts with the police politicians and even the courts standing intheir waywhile a very good film it somehow lacked the power of the sometimes these recreations felt a little moretheatrical the acting a bit more selfconscious the bad guys a bitmoustache twirling and john hurts character as the main investigativeforce felt a bit one note in his dogged approach not the fault of thisvery fine actor who brings as much life to the character as possiblebut seemingly the script which has a few too many scenes of hurt in aroom with someone pressing them for details in a similar way i wouldguess real life journalists have to vary their tactics more dependingon the situationbut carping aside this is another in the body of solid films thatinvestigate what can happen when police and politics decide its moreimportant to convict someone then to convict the right one
in the long tired jason series you have to admit putting him into space was a riskand for the most part it works the special effex are very well done and the use of holograms is neat and different it just seems that they havent improved much in the casting department most of the victims were people we never got to know so their deaths were rather meaningless lisa ryder as the android was lively and an asset to the cast david cronenbergs cameo is effective jonathan potts as professor lowe was too hammy without ever being threatening as paul reiser was in aliens they needed somebody like bruce dern or bill paxton anyway theres little new in this movie jason runs around killing people and the end has two or three climaxes jason has been fun for about eleven or twelve movies now lets put him to rest and find a new kind of horror
i didnt read all the review so i did not know that these movies were not in english but had english subtitles i like to do things while watching movies and because i had to read the movie i could do nothing else this show came up in response to my search for british mysteries so naturally i thought it was produced by the british like wallander that being said it was a good story although it made both sweden and denmark look dismally bleak from what little i knew about these two countries they are very temperate and lovely you wouldnt know that from this movie ive only watched the first one and the story was quite compelling so im not altogether displeased but the other two episodes will be something i save for a rainy day
the movie is played out against the backdrop of the la riots in the early s following the rodney king trial and centers around the corruption and nefarious activities of an elite police unit kurt russell plays the son of a son of a son of a cop whos legacy has always been shoot beat or kill first and ask question afterwards we see how over time he has almost unwittingly become buried under a veil of corruption which he now can not seem to dig his way out of dealing with inter department investigations a new naive partner and a failed marriage all add up to cause a constant self battle which is ultimately self destructive russell is actually very good and the movie on the whole is enjoyable unfortunately even the most innattentive viewer will have figured out how this movie will end after about only minutes it is a good script but there is no real tension the sleeve says have you on the edge of your which is sadly not true the viewer never really cares about the characters and one never feels drawn in or involved enough to really care about the outcome one for a rainy afternoon only
this is the rare modern western masterpiece that hollywood seems otherwise incapable of producing anymore the plot is spare a notorious exkiller william munny clint eastwood reformed by his nowdeceased wife is running an unsuccessful pig farm when he is recruited by an aspiring young gun kid schofield james woolvetkid wants munny to join him to kill two ranch hands in order to collect a bounty the reward is offered by the prostitutes of a brothel one of the ranch hands has disfigured the face of one of their girls reluctant at first because of the memory of his beloved wife munny decides to join the kid in order to collect the money in order to try to save his farm and provide for two children munny then recruits his friend former partner and expert rifleman ned logan morgan freemangene hackman as the town sheriff of big whiskey wyoming where the crime took place is the formidable obstacle standing in their way he has already meted out his form of justice to the ranch hands and is not about to countenance someone else doing so this is vividly and violently seen in a cameo by richard harris who is the first bounty hunter to arrive hackmans performance combining his easy charm with a vicious ruthlessness is terrific he deservedly won an academy award for best supporting actorthe dialogue is simple and direct in the john wayne tradition however eastwoods munny is no hondo out to tame the wild west he is a product of the dark side of his time and environment the mood is dark technically sometimes the lighting is too dark at his age eastwood is the perfectly grizzled cowboy and has an unforgiving coldeyed meanness that slowly reemerges as the movie progresses it fully emerges in a breathtakingly violent unrelenting brutality in the final scene in the bar at big whiskey where the prostitutes reside and ply their tradewoolvetz and freeman are excellent in their supporting roles but this classic is dominated by the outsize personas of eastwood and hackman if you like the old cowboy movies where the emphasis is on old west mores and not computergenerated pyrotechnics you will treasure this movie as we treasure the old western mythology
john madden and gwyneth paltrow first collaborated on in one of the most intelligent lush romantic comedies of all time they reunite to make a completely different kind of magic in a film adaptation of a wildly popular play in which paltrow also played the is steeped in the culture of mathematic academia where words like are used with hallowed reverence and the leading figures are considered to be gods by the professors and grad students paltrow plays katherine younger daughter to a mathematical genius anthony hopkins who the field twice before he turned but dad recently died after a long mental illness and katherine put her own academic life on hold to care for her dottering old man as they rattle around their big chicago house together katherine insists that dad has some lucid times where he was working again working on something great could it be found in the hundreds of notebooks dad left behind in his study grad student hal jake gyllenhaal is plowing through the books as fast as he can one has to suspend a little disbelief here believing that any university has lookers like paltrow and gyllenhall in the same math department hal and katherine also have a bit of a thing going but both of them move with the caution bred from working too close for too long a time ive never really been a fan of gyllenhaal before but he gives a sincere restrained performance that is just perfectand then theres claire hope davis katherines older sister who has flown in from new york to help out claire has clearly abandoned mathematics as a career and has moved on to more practical lucrative pursuits although her job is never explained claire has the disadvantage of being a merely person born into a family of geniuses and its pretty clear that shes got plenty of her own issues davis giving yet another fine performance conveys much of claires repressed frustration with brittle mannerisms and inflections but neverteless she conveys a lotbut paltrow is the true shining light here far from the radiant beauty she plays in virtually every film paltrow here is haggard worn thin by her years of caring for dad and also the worry that she might be in both good ways and bad its pretty clear that every character plus shes carrying a secret either she has gone beyond her fathers genius and discovered a new proof that had eluded the old guy or she has stolen his work and tried to pass it off as her own paltrow one of the sunniest of actresses here comes of as believable as a soul in tormentthis is a clocking in at minutes and with a tightly focused plot and cast that doesnt mean that it isnt excellent along with and squid and the stands firmly in the short line of recent fantastic movies about academics and academia check it out
i recommend this movie for the craft that went into it i also recommend it for the story and its unexpected sensitivityfor the first half i thought it was very funny but took itsef too seriously when patrick stewart disguised so as to be incognito while away from his home as a construction worker asked his shrink if he thought the shrink felt stewart liked leaving his house dressed as one of the village people i thought id fall over laughing then it got quite serious and i started enjoying it on a totally different levelpatrick stewart claims without any supporting evidence to be a retired government spy who has fatal information regarding a current presidential hopeful fatal to stewart and fatal to the candidates futurea housekeeper is hired by stewarts daughter to avoid having him committed after various humorous interviews a sprightly young woman is hired and the war of nerves begins the plot is complicated as stewart realizes he is sucumbing to alzheimers i particularly enjoyed where he tries to memorize the standard quizzes asked by shrinks so the level of disease advancement wouldnt be so apparent during his regular shrink visitsthe acting by all is superb stewart continues to show why he isnt a onetrick ponyyes there are a few unexplained occurrences but the movie is quirky enough to not be bothered by these little things the ending is well done and one doesnt need those silly little text messages to explain what the director forgot to or how to put in the moviethis is a fun movie enjoy it
margaret rutherford is without question the best actress to ever play the sharp busybody amateur sleuth miss jane marple this particular dvd collection contains all of the miss marple blackandwhite films each in their own individual clamshell case im not a fan of the doubledisk films since its easy to get fingerprints scratches on both sides of the disk which means increased risk of having a film that skips pauses note theres a new version coming out with discs doublesided i personally dont mind the extra inchwider box since dvd cases are already quite thin and any thinner would make the back spine impossible to readi bought this at an alllow price on thanksgiving day ie and thought this was one of the best purchases of the year the film transfer quality including the sound is great and youll find yourself tapping your toes at the music score great films to watch if youre into hollywood classic films an anglophile or simply a fan of cheeky british humor

funny games is the tale of two sociopaths who enjoy killing rich people the dialogue is a stark statement on the chilling emptiness that can be found inside the human mind i am jaded enough that the executions and gore didnt really touch my blood pressure maybe a little the victimology and wimpiness of the victims was what set me offwestern society is really training people to play roles like the one portrayed in funny games by the time you realize youre fked it is too late to do anything about it funny games is neither good nor bad it portrays what happens when senseless evil visits and you havent spent any time getting ready for your guest to arriveanother reviewer stated strongly that this is not a film for children i disagree if i were a father i would sit through this film with my teenager and then explain to him or her that yes there really are people like these people in the world and yes if someone can fake it on film then it can really happen to real people yes there are psychos roaming the world yes you can be mentally prepared better than the victims portrayed in funny games for that rare unlikely encounter that will probably never happen but it could
nybody like me who has actually read the eta hoffmann story nuszligknacker und mausekoumlnig will recognize that its period setting major themes and characters remain mostly intact many of the characters lines actions and dilemmas are lifted straight from the original well done even tchaikovskys music written for the famous ballet was not too severely rearrangedsome melding with the ballet was done with generally good results there of course had to be some story trimming here there and some sugarcoating to keep the story and action kidfriendly and not too frightening by the sensibilities of the day today years after its production the pc crowd would probably deem it too violent and threateningtheres weapons like swords cannons fer gosh sake oh the horror at least clara is still a scrapper if not more so than marie in the originalthe only quibble is that the story has the obligatory cant stay in resolution that has been plaguing kidfantasy adaptations since the baumtomgm rewrite of wonderful wizard of and the like but it ends well and believably for all that highly recommended

t what point does bad filmmaking become criminal wherever that line is it was surely crossed with sexual predator the film industrys equivalent to a lanced boil this pairs richard grieco and angie everhart both doing their best to live up to the dynamic duo of shannon tweed and andrew stevens and both failing miserably the plot revolves around a probation officer the swimsuit model and one of her assigned offenders the jumpstreeter it tackles such moral quandaries as should a sexually traumatized person be in charge of the parole of a man who killed their best friend through severe sexual trauma tough philosophical questions like these abound in the directed by robert angelo frankly its surprising that the has credits at all one can only speculate blackmail or some equally heinous maneuver led those participating to attach their names to this debacle the is of course directed at the yearold male audience with access to cinemax the though fails to titillate although extremely stupid members of the target audience might be able to disengage from the horror that is the rest of the film and focus on only the sex scenes i detracted one star each for the acting directing production script sound cinematography makeup score and casting i gave back five stars either hoping that the starring freckled beauty would go on a date with me or because amazon does not allow for reviews lower than star i recommend years in marion for all key members of the team

pulp fiction is the magnum opus of filmmaker quentin tarantino it is a film that is centered upon the lives of criminals dope dealers sadists and other colorful characters the movie is rich with detail with references tomarijuana culture among other thingsthis movie is filmed in the humdrum early s style of los angeles the characters go to working class diners working class apartments and buy drugs in a modest house only the top gangsters house is sheik through these settings dialogue is maximized where every emotion is expressed in colorful but vulgar terms in several different but interesting and novel waysthere are many reviews on this movie it is perhaps one of the greatest films ever producedeasily the best film of the s decade what then makes this movie so powerful there are many reviews about this film there is also an equal number of speculative meanings perhaps this ambiguity or multiple layers of meanings is what makes the film so powerfulif there is a central theme it is atonement the three major characters butch vincent jules each have an experience where they can alter what they are doing and thereby seek out the transcendent and honorable butch and jules both do so vincent does not and he is killed by his own gun his body left hunched on a toiletthe rest of tarantinos movies lurch from wordy snore fests to wordy cruel slasher films this film is his greatest work it is not only above quentin tarantinos normal fare it is above most other movies
the eleven episodes of speed racer on this dvd are a surefire way to bring nostalgic parents and their wideeyed children closer together i just got this and my fouryearold has barely watched anything else since it went in the dvd player im not the worlds biggest chimchim and spritle fan but my son cant get enoughall i remember of the show from my childhood is the catchy refrain in the theme song and that i loved watching it personally the problems people have had with the opening and closing titles being different arent a big issue for me and im not watching with a stopwatch so time compression isnt a big deal either the shows themselves are what i got the dvd for and as far as im concerned theyre greatthats not to say the dvd is perfect ive noticed an occasional audio quotchirpingquot glitch here and there but not enough to be a problem my biggest problem is that your viewing choices are limited to quotplay allquot or each episode individually and that you cant chapter advance while quotplaying allquot so if i want to watch the threepart quotthe most dangerous racequot i can sit through the first episodes or after watching episode i have to push quotplayquot again for ep and then again for not the biggest of deals but along with the fact that the episodes arent broken into chapters either if you stop watching rds of the way through be sure to set a bookmark or be ready to fastforward forever it makes it difficult to watch the dvd the way you want to watch itthe extras are nice but nothing incredible although the footage of the mids remake makes you appreciate the original even more a trivia section explaining things like why speed has a quotgquot on his shirt or why cars change colors halfway through the big turn in the opening sequence would have been nice granted most of that is available on the internet but having it on the disk would have been better than pictures of a few items of speed memorabilia with no context attached to themi know this review has been mostly drawing attention to the dvds flaws but i still stand by my star rating the individual episodes are wonderful the stories while occasionally hokey are engaging and fun the artwork and sound are great and then theres that theme song whoa nellie minor gripes aside this is a great dvd for young and old dont miss it
cal heros just wonderful a charming thing this movie is funny and happy and melancholy and in some ways pretty dark all at the same time the spontaneity of tone is impeccable ive never seen a film that so effortlessly allows its characters to drive its plot theres never a false moment and yet the plot itself is actually pretty highly developed in its ersatz way its all just wonderful and spontaneous and lovely thats alli would recommend local hero extremely highly to anyone who appreciated northern exposure at its height there are some very strong similarities among them the distinctive locations and the extensive set of well rounded character roles i often wondered if the tv show was directly inspired by the filmbill forsythe the scottish director of local hero made a career of little characterbased comedies gregorys girl is another likeable movie of his that made us distribution he tried to move to hollywood at one point but got stuck working with burt reynolds in a sort of well made but poorly cast caper flick and probably left in disgust
scrapped princess is one of those series thats simply enjoyable to watch from start to finish the main characters are all likeable a huge plus for an anime very focused on the central characters the plot is great and the music is good theres not much more you can ask for out of an anime is there the problem the r scrapped princess dvds for whatever reason nearly all the episodes suffer from serious dot crawl and shimmeringrainbowing issues that would really ruin the visuals for anyone watching on a hdtvlcd monitor the episodes suffering from dot crawl are easy to spot since the title shows at its worst right at the start and you cant really miss the shimmeringrainbowing i hoped these issues would only exist on the first episodes after they vanished on episodes and but the issues are there in the vast majority of the episodesthe r aussie dvds dont show the dotcrawl and shimmeringrainbowing issues anywhere near as much so its rather shocking the r releases were allowed to be sold without these issues being worked out as much as possibleim giving this a because the series itself is excellent and this set is very cheap for whats included my rating would be if it was for the individual volumes due to how bad the video quality is
sinbad is absolutely hysterically funny without being foul or vulgar not one swear word or inappropriate innuendo totally family friendly but so darned funny that this left me in stitches excellent video to show at a party family get together or just with friends hanging out every dvd of his has hilarious insights into malefemale relations but with not one repeat of material this guy sees into the humor of the dymamics with a fresh perspective every time and leaves you saying thats me or done that while rolling on the floor cracking up the only thing that surprised me was that he didnt use want the by parliament as the song when he was musically describing what was but the song he used be was good anyway a must purchase if you like to laugh
this girl has a gift give her a feeling and she has the perfect hilarious facial expression to express itany woman has experienced the feeling of wanting to win someone special well this girl took it to a new leveli am not into teenage movies but when this girls antics started i have to say it was one of the funniest movies ive seenshes creative to say the least another good thing this movie is very clean and wholesome and every scene no matter how weird it gets seems real with her great acting theres one scene i wont forget but i wont ruin it ill just say the strange noises were timely he he h
discover paris the way you would probably never see it garbage collecting trucks shown three times in the film the french police that understands english and does not like nervous americans and they send their incognito agents behind the man they have more or less sent to hell the us embassy obviously speaking with a forked tongue being reassuring on one side and sending its secret agents behind the american citizen at once without telling him of course s for shead as dr walker says then a statue of liberty the original mind you seen and shown nearly too much underground parking lots that are crime avenues parisian zinc roofs french taxis with black taxi drivers getting a flat on a highway then constant contradictions between tipping and not tipping in hotels and all kinds of dealings and dealers along the rivers embankments in all kinds of underground structures or airports or night clubs or bars or whatever a dangerous life for simple american tourists but vacations remembered forever anyway in paris only the french and the arabs apparently die funny more than thrilling but well acted and that is a real pleasuredr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
not exactly hog heaven im not entirely certain they knew what they wanted to do with this movie so they did everything if frantic is your taste this would be it a giant snowball from hell gathering up everything in its path as it barrels down on you theres no escape few survive which is always the case but i actually like a high body count in these types of movies the pig was a bit plastic looking but thats okay it made its point dont tread on mei didnt keep it glad i saw it and yes if theres a pig hunt itd watch it alsoand what a great dvd cover
i am glad that columbia tristar is recognizing shemp but the problem with this dvd is that they released one of the worst shemp remakes in my opinion quotbubble troublequot but hey i do enjoy every stooge short i see plus theyre releasing quotdizzy doctorsquot one of curlys best shorts they are also finally releasing quotbrideless groomquot a short that has been presented in poor quality in those cheap s tapes for so long and it is also considered the best short by shemp fans now if they would only release some better remakes like quotof cash and hashquot or quotloose lootquot
